CHAPTER
I.

THREE
CHARACTERS
ARE
INTRODUCED.


It
was
early
in
the
afternoon
of
a
July
day.
A
warm
sun
beaming
down
with
almost
tropical
fervency
glinted
through
the
open
windows
of
an
office
in
the
foreign
settlement
of
Yokohama,
Japan.
The
room,
a
large
one,
furnished
with
desks
and
chairs,
and
the
various
equipments
of
such
an
apartment,
contained
a
solitary
occupant.

He--it
was
a
youth
of
not
more
than
nineteen
years
of
age--was
leaning
back
in
an
easy,
revolving
chair,
with
his
hands
resting
upon
an
account
book
laid
open
on
a
light
bamboo
desk.
His
face,
as
seen
in
the
glare
of
the
light,
was
peculiar.
The
expression
was
that
termed
old-fashioned
by
some.
He
had
queer,
puckered
eyes,
and
many
wrinkles
here
and
there,
but
the
chin
was
firm
and
resolute,
and
the
forehead
lofty--marks
of
intelligence
and
great
shrewdness.

There
was
something
in
the
pose
of
the
body,
however,
that
did
not
denote
either
gracefulness
or
symmetry.
Presently
he
arose
from
his
chair
and
moved
with
a
halting
gait
toward
window
opening
into
an
outer
court.
Then
it
became
evident
that
he
was
a
cripple.

One
leg,
the
right,
was
shorter
than
its
mate.
There
was
also
a
droop
in
the
shoulders
that
betokened
a
lack
of
physical
strength,
or
many
years
of
ill
health.
Notwithstanding
this
misfortune,
the
youth
had
a
cheerful
nature.
As
he
glanced
out
into
the
court,
with
its
huge-leafed
palms,
shady
maples,
and
the
ever-present
bamboos,
he
whistled
softly
to
himself.

Presently
the
faint
tinkling
notes
of
a
_samisen_--a
native
square-shaped
banjo--came
to
his
ears
from
a
neighboring
building.
Then
the
rat-tat
of
the
hourglass-shaped
drum
called
_tsuzumi_
joined
in,
and
the
air
was
filled
with
a
weird
melody.

With
something
like
a
sigh,
the
young
man
turned
back
to
his
work.
Bending
over
the
book,
he
added
up
interminable
columns
of
figures,
jotting
down
the
results
upon
a
pad
at
his
elbow.

A
stranger
entering
from
the
teeming
street
would
have
noted
something
amiss
in
this
office.
He
would
have
seen
that
the
half-dozen
desks,
with
the
exception
of
that
being
used
by
the
solitary
occupant,
were
thickly
covered
with
dust.

A
delicate
tracery
of
cobwebs
held
in
its
bondage
the
majority
of
the
chairs.
There
were
others
festooning
the
row
of
books
and
pasteboard
files
upon
a
number
of
shelves
lining
the
walls.
Over
in
one
corner
was
an
open
fireplace,
looking
grim
and
rusted,
and
above
a
lacquered
side
table
swung
a
parrot
cage,
desolate
and
empty.
It
was
a
scene
of
disuse,
and
it
had
its
meaning.

It
was
the
counting-room
of
John
Manning,
"Importer
and
Trader,"
as
a
tarnished
gilt
sign
over
the
outer
door
informed
the
passerby.
But
the
master
of
it,
and
of
the
huge
warehouse
back
on
the
bay,
had
gone
to
his
last
rest
many
months
before.

He
had
been
the
sole
owner
of
the
business--which
rumor
said
had
fallen
into
decay--and
when
he
went
to
join
his
helpmate,
he
left
two
sons
to
fight
the
battle
of
life.
One,
Grant
Manning,
we
now
see
hard
at
work
in
the
old
office.
The
other,
Nathaniel
Manning,
or
"Nattie,"
as
he
was
familiarly
called
by
his
associates,
was
at
that
moment
on
his
way
to
the
office
to
join
his
brother.

Just
fifteen
years
had
John
Manning
conducted
business
as
an
importer
and
trader
in
the
foreign
quarter
of
Yokohama.
At
first
his
firm
had
prospered,
but
the
coming
of
new
people,
and
severe
competition
had
finally
almost
forced
the
American
to
the
wall.

He
died
leaving
his
affairs
in
a
muddle,
and
now
Grant,
after
months
of
delay
and
litigation,
was
puzzling
his
brain
over
the
carelessly
kept
books
and
accounts.
Five
years
previous
Nattie
had
been
sent
home
to
New
England
to
school.
He
was
on
the
point
of
entering
Harvard
when
the
word
came
that
his
father
had
suddenly
passed
away.

In
the
letter
Grant
had
added
that
but
little
remained
of
their
father's
money,
and
that
his
presence
was
also
needed
to
help
settle
the
accounts.
For
several
months
after
Nattie's
arrival
in
Japan
nothing
could
be
done.
At
last
the
elder
brother
had
cleared
up
matters
sufficiently
for
the
boys
to
see
where
they
stood.

On
the
day
on
which
this
story
opens
Grant
had
arranged
an
appointment
with
his
brother,
and
was
now
awaiting
his
coming
with
the
patience
characteristic
of
him.

The
task
he
had
taken
upon
himself
was
not
the
lightest
in
the
world.
The
books
were
in
almost
hopeless
confusion,
but
by
dint
of
hard
application
Grant
had
finally
made
out
a
trial
balance
sheet.
As
he
was
adding
the
finishing
touches
to
this,
he
suddenly
heard
the
sounds
of
an
animated
controversy
in
the
street.

An
exclamation
uttered
in
a
familiar
voice
caused
him
to
hastily
leave
his
desk
and
open
the
door
leading
outside.
As
he
did
so
a
couple
of
_jinrikishas_--two-wheeled
carriages
pulled
by
coolies--came
into
sudden
collision
directly
in
front
of
the
office.
Each
vehicle
was
occupied
by
a
fashionably
dressed
lad.

They
were
gesticulating
angrily,
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
coming
to
blows.
The
_kurumayas_,
or
_jinrikisha_
men,
were
also
bent
on
hostilities,
and
the
extraordinary
scene
was
attracting
a
dense
crowd
of
blue-costumed
natives.
Rushing
bareheaded
into
the
street,
Grant
grasped
one
of
the
lads
by
the
arm,
and
exclaimed:

"What
under
the
sun
does
this
mean,
Nattie?
What
is
the
cause
of
this
disgraceful
row?"

"It's
that
cad,
Ralph
Black,"
was
the
wrathful
reply.
"He
made
his
_kurumaya_
run
the
_'rikisha_
in
front
of
mine
on
purpose
to
provoke
a
quarrel.
He
will
have
enough
of
it
if
he
don't
look
out."

"Not
from
you,
Nattie
Manning!"
insolently
called
out
the
youth
in
the
other
vehicle.
"You
are
very
high
and
mighty
for
a
pauper."

Nattie
gave
a
leap
from
his
carriage
with
the
evident
intention
of
wreaking
summary
vengeance
upon
his
insulter,
but
he
was
restrained
by
Grant.

Ralph
Black,
a
stocky-built
youth
of
eighteen,
with
an
unhealthy
complexion,
probably
thought
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valor
as
he
hastily
bade
his
_kurumaya_
carry
him
from
the
spot.

The
brothers
gave
a
final
glance
after
the
disappearing
_jinrikisha_,
and
then
entered
the
office,
leaving
the
crowd
of
straw-sandaled
natives
to
disperse
before
the
efforts
of
a
tardy
policeman.

"Nattie,
when
will
you
ever
learn
to
avoid
these
disgraceful
rows?"
remarked
Grant,
seating
himself
at
his
desk.
"Since
your
return
from
the
States
you
have
quarreled
with
Ralph
Black
four
or
five
times."

"I
acknowledge
it,
brother,
but,
really,
I
can't
help
it,"
replied
Nattie,
throwing
himself
into
a
chair.
"The
confounded
cad
forces
himself
upon
me
whenever
he
can.
He
is
insolent
and
overbearing,
and
I
won't
stand
it.
You
know
I
never
liked
Ralph.
Before
I
left
for
the
States
we
were
always
rowing.
He
is
a
mean,
contemptible
sneak,
and
if
there
is
anything
on
earth
I
hate
it
is
that."

The
lad's
face
flushed
with
passion,
and
as
he
spoke
he
struck
the
arm
of
the
chair
with
his
clinched
fist.
In
both
appearance
and
actions,
the
brothers
were
totally
different.
Stalwart
for
his
age,
clean-limbed,
a
handsome
face,
crowned
by
dark,
clustering
hair,
Nattie
would
have
attracted
admiration
anywhere.

As
stated
before,
Grant
was
a
cripple,
deformed
and
possessed
of
a
quaint,
old-fashioned
countenance,
but
readers
of
human
nature
would
have
lingered
longer
over
the
breadth
of
his
brow,
and
the
kindly,
resolute
chin.
Nattie
would
have
delighted
athletes,
but
his
elder
brother--a
truce
to
descriptions,
let
their
characters
speak
for
themselves
as
the
story
progresses.

Grant
smiled
reprovingly.
He
had
a
great
liking
for
Nattie,
but
he
regretted
his
impulsiveness.
None
knew
better
than
he
that
the
lad
was
all
right
in
his
heart,
but
he
needed
a
rudder
to
his
ship
of
life.

"I
suppose
it
is
hard
to
bear
sometimes,"
he
acknowledged.
"It
is
a
pity
that
you
are
compelled
to
antagonize
the
fellow
just
when
we
are
placed
in
such
a
predicament.
I
have
gone
over
the
books
from
end
to
end,
but
I
declare
I
can't
find
any
further
references
to
the
payment
of
the
debt."

"We
are
sure
father
settled
it,
anyway."

"But
we
can't
prove
it,
more's
the
pity.
The
last
entry
in
father's
personal
account
book
is
this:
'Paid
this
date
the
sum
of
five
thousand,
six
hundred
dollars
($5,600.00)
to----'
it
ends
there."
Grant's
voice
lowered
as
he
added:
"At
that
moment
he
fell
from
his
chair,
you
know,
and
died
before
help
could
come."

Both
were
silent
for
a
while,
then
Nattie
reached
for
the
book
in
question,
and
glanced
over
it.
Finally
he
said,
with
decision:

"That
entry
certainly
means
that
father
paid
back
Mr.
Black
the
debt
of
five
thousand
dollars,
with
six
per
cent.
interest
for
two
years,
on
the
day
of
his
death."

"There
isn't
the
slightest
doubt
of
it
in
my
mind.
I
cannot
find
the
faintest
trace
of
any
similar
debt
in
the
books.
But
Mr.
Black
swears
the
amount
was
not
paid,
and
he
threatens
to
sue
the
estate."

"Nice
work
for
a
reputable
English
exporting
merchant.
But
I
don't
put
it
above
him.
The
sire
of
such
a
son
as
Ralph
Black
would
do
almost
anything,
in
my
opinion."




CHAPTER
II.

NATTIE
ARRIVES
OPPORTUNELY.


"I
am
afraid
he
will
push
us
to
the
wall
if
he
can,"
replied
Grant,
taking
up
the
balance
sheet.
"If
Mr.
Black
compels
us
to
pay,
or
rather
repay
the
debt,
it
will
leave
us
penniless.
This
little
trouble
with
Ralph
will
probably
cause
him
to
take
immediate
action.
Ralph
has
great
influence
over
his
father,
you
know."

"How
does
the
estate
stand?"
asked
Nattie,
flecking
a
speck
of
dust
from
his
carefully
creased
trousers.

"Badly
enough.
Briefly
speaking,
our
liabilities,
not
counting
the
Black
debt,
are
seventy-three
thousand,
eight
hundred
and
ten
dollars
and
forty-three
cents,
and
the
available
assets,
including
everything--this
building,
the
warehouse,
and
our
home
on
the
heights--are
exactly
eighty
thousand
dollars."

"Then
we
would
have
over
six
thousand
dollars
to
the
good
if
we
could
prove
that
father
had
really
paid
the
English
importing
merchant?"

"Yes,
in
round
numbers.
Six
thousand
one
hundred
and
eighty-nine
dollars
and
fifty-seven
cents.
But
there
is
no
use
in
beating
around
the
bush,
Nattie.
We
must
face
the
issue
squarely.
We
can't
prove
it,
and
we
are
ruined."

The
younger
brother
sprang
to
his
feet
and
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
the
office.
There
was
a
gleam
in
his
eyes
that
boded
ill
for
certain
persons
if
they
should
ever
be
placed
in
his
power.
Halting
abruptly
in
front
of
Grant,
he
said,
passionately:

"It's
a
confounded
shame
that
we
should
lose
everything.
Father
was
fifteen
years
building
up
this
trade,
and
now
it
must
all
go
because
of
that
villain's
treachery.
You
have
gone
over
the
books
and
know
how
the
business
stands.
If
we
had
money
could
we
continue
the
business
with
any
success?"

"Well,
I
should
say
so,"
replied
Grant,
earnestly.
"We
have
been
agents
and
correspondents
of
the
best
American
houses.
Why,
when
the
business
stopped,
father
had
orders
for
almost
one
hundred
thousand
dollars'
worth
of
petroleum,
flour,
calico,
sugar
and
machinery.
Then
there
are
the
exports.
The
firm
of
Broadhead
&
Company,
of
Philadelphia,
wanted
a
consignment
of
rice
and
silk."

"You
are
well
known
to
the
government
people
also."

"None
better.
I
can
say
without
boasting
that
I
stand
higher
with
them
than
any
other
foreigner
in
business
here.
There
is
Yoshisada
Udono,
the
secretary
to
the
Minister
of
War;
and
the
sub-admiral
of
the
navy,
Tanaka
Tamotsu.
I
have
some
influence
with
both,
and
in
case
of
supplies
I
think
I
can
hold
my
own.
But
what
is
the
use
of
talking.
We
haven't
the
money,
nor
can
we
get
it."

Nattie
walked
over
to
the
window
leading
into
the
court,
and
glanced
thoughtfully
at
the
boxed
walks,
now
overgrown
with
weeds.
He
plucked
a
sprig
of
bamboo,
and
returned
to
the
center
of
the
room.
There
was
a
smile
upon
his
face.

"I
have
a
plan,
brother,
which
may
work
and
may
not,"
he
said.
"It
can
be
tried."

Grant
leaned
back
and
eyed
him
in
silence.

"You
remember
Mori
Okuma?"
continued
Nattie.

"Of
course.
I
know
him
well.
He
returned
to
Japan
with
you.
He
has
been
at
Yale
for
several
years.
What
about
him?"

"Coming
over
on
the
steamer
I
became
very
chummy
with
him.
He
is
as
nice
a
Japanese
youth
as
you
can
find
in
sight
of
the
volcano
of
Fuji
San,
which
about
includes
the
islands,
you
know.
Well,
his
people
are
dead,
and
he
is
the
sole
heir
to
over
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
good
hard
money."

"And
you
propose?"

"To
ask
him
to
go
in
with
us,"
replied
Nattie,
quietly.
"He
told
me
he
wished
to
invest
his
wealth
if
possible.
He
thought
of
returning
to
the
States,
but
he
can
be
talked
out
of
that.
What
do
you
think
of
it?"

Grant
was
visibly
excited.
He
arose
from
his
chair
and
paced
back
and
forth
with
queer
little
steps.
He
ran
one
white
hand
over
his
brow
in
a
way
he
had.
His
face
lost
some
of
its
careworn
expression,
and
he
finally
became
radiant
with
hope.

"Nattie,
if
we
can
induce
him
to
form
a
firm
with
us
our
fortunes
are
made,"
he
said,
eagerly.
"Twenty
thousand
dollars,
not
half
of
his
capital,
will
square
up
everything
and
place
us
in
running
order.
Just
think
of
it!
It
will
mean
the
defeat
of
many
ill-wishers;
it
will
save
father's
name
from
the
disgrace
of
a
failure,
and
it'll
keep
the
old
house
going.
When
can
you
see
him?
How
about
bringing
him
here
this
afternoon?
I
can
show
him
the
books
in
a
jiffy."

"I
declare,
brother,
this
is
really
the
first
time
I
ever
saw
you
excited,"
laughed
Nattie.
"Why,
you
positively
look
like
another
fellow.
Just
bide
here
for
a
while,
and
I'll
look
Mori
up.
He'll
be
down
to
the
tea
house
near
the
bank,
I
suppose."

He
brushed
his
sleeves
where
dust
from
the
desk
had
soiled
them,
jauntily
placed
his
cork
sun-helmet
upon
his
head,
and
sauntered
from
the
offices,
leaving
Grant
still
trotting
up
and
down
in
unwonted
animation.
The
latter
was
alert
and
boyish.
His
face
actually
beamed--it
was
wonderful
how
the
hope
had
changed
him.

The
mere
thought
that
money
might
be
secured
and
the
house--his
father's
firm
in
which
he
had
loved
to
labor--would
be
saved
from
the
disgrace
of
bankruptcy
was
enough.
The
youth--he
was
nothing
more
in
years--whistled
a
merry
air,
and
limped
to
the
window
leading
into
the
street.

Drawing
the
curtain
aside,
he
glanced
forth,
then
started
back
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise.

"Ah,
they
are
at
work
early,"
he
muttered.
"I
fancy
the
son's
malevolence
has
brought
this
call."

A
knock
sounded
at
the
door.
Grant
threw
it
open,
and
bowed
politely
to
a
man
and
a
youth
standing
upon
the
threshold.
The
former,
an
austere
Englishman,
with
dark
side
whiskers
and
a
peculiar
pallor
of
face,
entered
first.
He
was
followed
by
a
stocky-built
youth,
clad
in
fashionable
garments.
It
was
father
and
son,
comprising
the
well-known
firm
of
importers
and
traders,
Jesse
Black
&
Company.

Ralph
gave
Grant
a
malicious
glance
and
seemed
particularly
pleased
at
something.
The
elder
Black
marched
majestically
to
a
seat
near
the
center
of
the
desk,
and,
after
brushing
the
dust
from
it,
settled
himself
with
a
grunt.
All
this
with
not
a
word.

The
head
of
the
firm
glanced
half
contemptuously
at
the
many
evidences
of
disuse
surrounding
him;
then
he
drew
from
an
inner
pocket
a
bill
with
several
lines
of
writing
upon
it.
This
he
handed
to
Grant.

"I
suppose
you
know
why
I
am
here?"
he
asked,
in
a
harsh
voice.

"I
believe
I
can
guess,"
quietly
replied
the
cripple.

"That
bill
will
tell
you.
This
estate
owes
me
five
thousand,
six
hundred
dollars,
not
counting
later
interest.
I
need
the
money.
Can
you
pay
it
to-day?"

"Mr.
Black,
you
know
I
cannot.
It
is
simply
impossible.
I
am
trying
to
get
affairs
straightened
up
so
that
I
can
settle
father's
debts,
but
I
am
not
quite
ready."

"Make
him
pay
or
threaten
to
sue,"
muttered
Ralph,
in
a
voice
intended
for
his
father's
ears.

Grant
overheard
the
words,
however.
His
eyes,
generally
so
gentle,
flashed,
and
he
turned
sharply
on
the
ill-favored
youth.

"I
am
conducting
this
conversation
with
Mr.
Black,"
he
said,
sternly.
"I
understand
why
this
note
has
been
presented
to-day.
It
is
your
doings.
Simply
because
you
had
a
quarrel
with
my
brother,
and
he
threatened
to
chastise
you,
you
retaliate
by
demanding
this
money.
If
the
truth
was
known,
the
entire
debt
was
paid
by
my
father
on
the
day
of
his
death."

For
a
moment
a
silence
death-like
in
its
intensity
followed
this
bold
speech.
Father
and
son
glared
at
Grant
as
if
hardly
believing
their
ears.
The
elder
merchant's
pallor
seemed
to
increase,
and
he
furtively
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue.

Ralph's
face
paled,
and
then
flushed
until
the
cords
stood
out
in
his
forehead.
Clinching
his
fists
he
strode
over
to
where
the
cripple
was
standing
near
the
bamboo
desk.

"What's
that
you
say?"
he
demanded,
hoarsely.
"Do
you
know
what
you
mean,
you
puny
wretch?
It
is
an
accusation
of
fraud,
that's
what
it
is.
Retract
those
words,
or
I'll
cram
the
lie
down
your
throat."

If
Grant
had
faults,
cowardice
was
not
one
of
them.
He
thoroughly
realized
that
he
would
be
no
match
in
a
tussle
with
Ralph
Black,
but
that
fact
did
not
daunt
his
spirit.

"If
you
are
coward
enough
to
strike
me,
go
ahead,"
he
replied,
calmly.
"I
will
retract
nothing.
I
say
that
I
fully
believe
my
father
paid
your
debt
on
the
day
of
his
death.
I
know----"

He
was
interrupted
by
Ralph.
Wild
with
rage,
the
youth
reached
out
and
grasped
Grant
with
his
left
hand,
then
he
raised
the
other,
and
was
on
the
point
of
aiming
a
blow
at
him
when
the
front
door
suddenly
flew
back.
Two
young
men
stood
in
the
opening.

There
was
an
exclamation
of
amazement,
which
died
away
in
a
note
of
wrath,
then
one
of
the
newcomers
darted
forward,
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
Master
Ralph
found
himself
lying
under
a
tall
desk
considerably
confused
and
hurt,
both
bodily
and
in
feelings.

Then
Nattie,
for
it
was
he,
turned
on
Mr.
Black,
who
tried
to
speak,
but
only
stammering
words
came
from
his
lips.
The
merchant
had
watched
the
affair
with
dilated
eyes.
He
remained
motionless
until
he
saw
his
son
stricken
down;
then,
with
a
cry,
he
snatched
up
a
heavy
ruler
lying
upon
the
bamboo
desk.

As
he
raised
it
to
strike
at
Nattie,
the
latter's
companion,
who
had
hitherto
remained
in
the
doorway,
ran
forward
and
grasped
his
arm.
There
was
a
brief
struggle,
in
which
both
Nattie
and
the
newcomer
participated,
then
the
Blacks,
father
and
son,
found
themselves
forced
into
the
street.

[Illustration:

CHAPTER
III.

GRANT
IS
MYSTERIOUS.


The
occupants
of
the
office
waited
for
a
few
moments
to
see
if
the
English
merchant
and
his
hopeful
offspring
cared
to
continue
the
scrimmage,
but
no
attempt
was
made
to
open
the
door.
Nattie
glanced
through
the
window,
and
saw
them
retreating
up
the
street
as
fast
as
they
could
walk.

"Well,
did
you
ever
see
the
beat
of
that?"
he
finally
exclaimed,
turning
back
to
his
companions.
"What
is
the
meaning
of
it
all,
brother?"

Grant,
who
was
still
fuming
with
indignation,
explained
the
affair
in
detail.
Presently
he
quieted
down
and
concluded
by
saying,
regretfully:

"I
am
very
sorry
it
occurred.
To
have
such
a
row
in
this
office
is
simply
disgraceful.
It
also
means
an
immediate
suit
for
that
debt,
and
any
amount
of
trouble."

"We'll
see
if
it
can't
be
prevented,"
replied
Nattie,
cheerfully.
"This
is
Mori
Okuma,
brother.
You
remember
him."

The
lame
youth
turned
with
outstretched
hand
and
a
smile
of
welcome
to
his
brother's
friend.
The
young
Japanese,
whose
modest
garb
and
quiet
manner
proclaimed
the
high-class
native,
responded
cordially
to
the
greeting.
He
appeared
to
be
not
more
than
eighteen
years
of
age.
He
had
the
kindly
eyes
and
gentle
expression
of
his
race.

"I
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
for
your
assistance,"
said
Grant.
"But
I
must
apologize
for
such
a
scene.
It
is
unfortunate
that
you
found
this
generally
respectable
office
the
theatre
for
a
brawl.
Believe
me,
it
was
entirely
unsolicited
on
my
part."

"Oh,
Mori
don't
mind
that,"
broke
in
Nattie,
with
a
laugh.
"I'll
wager
a
_yen_
it
reminded
him
of
old
times.
He
was
center
rush
in
the
Yale
football
team,
you
know."

Mori
smiled,
and
shook
a
warning
finger
at
his
friend.

"I
must
confess
that
it
did
me
good
to
see
that
old
scoundrel
thrown
into
the
street,"
he
said,
naïvely.
"I
know
him
well.
My
father
had
dealings
with
him
several
years
ago.
And
the
son
is
a
savage,
too.
He
intended
to
strike
you,
the
coward."

"I'll
settle
all
scores
with
him
one
of
these
days,"
said
Nattie,
grimly.
Then
he
added,
in
a
businesslike
voice:
"I
have
spoken
to
Mori
about
the
firm,
brother.
He
thinks
favorably
of
the
idea,
and
is
willing
to
consult
with
us
on
the
subject.
Suppose
you
show
him
the
books
and
explain
matters."

"I
will
do
that
with
the
greatest
pleasure,"
replied
Grant,
smilingly.
"I
presume
my
brother
has
told
you
about
how
we
stand,
Mr.
Okuma?"

"Oh,
bother
formalities!"
exclaimed
Nattie,
with
characteristic
impatience.
"Call
him
Mori.
He
is
one
of
us."

The
young
Japanese
bowed
courteously.

"We
are
friends,"
he
said,
"and
I
hope
we
will
soon
be
partners."

The
lame
youth
fervently
echoed
the
wish.
Calling
attention
to
the
balance
sheet
he
had
recently
drawn
up,
he
explained
the
items
in
detail,
proving
each
statement
by
ample
documents.
Mori
listened
intelligently,
nodding
his
approval
from
time
to
time.

Presently
Nattie
slipped
out
into
the
street,
returning
after
a
while
with
a
_musmee_,
a
native
tea-house
waitress.
The
girl,
_petite_
and
graceful
in
her
light-blue
robe
and
voluminous
_obi_,
carried
in
her
hands
a
lacquered
tray,
upon
which
were
three
dainty
cups
and
a
pot
of
tea.

Sinking
to
her
knees
near
the
desk,
the
_musmee_
placed
the
tray
on
the
floor,
and
proceeded
to
serve
the
fragrant
liquid.
Work
was
stopped
to
partake
of
the
usual
afternoon
refreshments,
and
the
boys
chatted
on
various
subjects
for
five
or
ten
minutes.

Finally
Nattie
gave
the
_musmee_
a
few
_sen_
(Japanese
cents)
and
dismissed
her.
She
performed
several
elaborate
courtesies,
and
withdrew
as
silently
as
she
had
come.
The
task
of
explaining
the
affairs
of
the
firm
of
John
Manning
was
resumed.

"Now
you
understand
everything,"
said
Grant,
half
an
hour
later.
"You
can
see
that
with
fresh
capital
we
should
carry
on
quite
an
extensive
business.
The
Black
debt,
which
I
explained
to
you,
has
crippled
us
so
that
we
will
have
to
fail
if
we
can't
secure
money.
We
believe
it
was
paid,
but
unfortunately,
there
are
no
traces
of
the
receipt."

"I
hardly
think
Mr.
Black
would
hesitate
to
do
anything
for
money,"
replied
Mori,
thoughtfully.
"Your
esteemed
father
undoubtedly
settled
the
debt."

"We
have
written
contracts
with
the
twelve
American
houses
on
this
list,"
continued
Grant.
"Then
there
is
the
chance
of
securing
that
order
from
the
government
for
the
Maxim
revolving
cannon
and
the
fifteen
million
cartridges.
We
also
have
a
standing
order
for
lacquered
ware
with
four
New
York
firms.
In
fact,
we
would
have
ample
business
for
eight
months
ahead."

"There's
money
in
it,
Mori,"
chimed
in
Nattie.
"I
can't
explain
things
like
Grant,
but
I
believe
we
can
carry
the
majority
of
trade
in
this
city
and
Tokio.
What
do
you
think
of
it?"

"I
am
quite
impressed,"
replied
the
Japanese
youth,
with
a
smile.
"I
have
no
doubt
that
we
can
do
an
extensive
business.
You
will
pardon
me
if
I
defer
giving
you
an
answer
until
to-morrow
at
this
hour.
As
I
understand
it,
you
wish
me
to
invest
twenty
thousand
_yen_
against
your
experience
and
the
orders
on
hand?"

"And
our
contracts,"
quickly
replied
Grant.
"They
are
strictly
first-class."

"And
the
contracts,"
repeated
Mori,
bowing.
"They
are
certainly
valuable.
I
think
you
can
rely
upon
a
favorable
answer
to-morrow.
Until
then
I
will
say
_sayonara_."

"_Sayonara_.
We
will
be
here
at
four
o'clock
to-morrow
afternoon,"
said
Nattie
and
Grant,
seeing
their
new
friend
to
the
door.

"Now,
I
call
that
settled,"
exclaimed
the
former,
tossing
his
helmet
in
the
air
and
adroitly
catching
it
on
the
end
of
his
cane.
"I
am
certain
Mori
will
go
in
with
us.
He's
a
thoroughly
good
fellow,
and
can
be
depended
on."

Grant
was
not
so
demonstrative,
but
the
happy
expression
on
his
face
spoke
volumes.
He
bustled
about
the
office,
restoring
the
books
to
the
safe,
closed
the
various
windows,
and
then
announced,
cheerily:

"I
think
we
deserve
a
little
vacation,
Nattie.
Suppose
we
knock
off
now
and
have
an
early
dinner
out
at
home.
Then
we
can
go
to
the
theatre
to-night.
Horikoshi
Shu
is
going
to
play
in
the
'Forty-seven
Ronins.'"

His
brother
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
if
the
latter
prospect
was
not
entirely
to
his
taste.

"I
confess
I
can't
see
much
in
Japanese
theatricals
since
my
visit
to
the
States,"
he
replied,
"but
we'll
take
it
in.
Dinner
first,
eh?
Well,
come
along."

Leaving
the
office
to
the
care
of
a
watchman,
they
walked
down
the
street
toward
the
custom
house.
Grant
recognized
and
bowed
to
a
score
of
persons
within
the
few
blocks.
It
was
evident
that
he
was
well
known
in
the
foreign
mercantile
circles
of
Yokohama.

"They
will
be
surprised
when
they
hear
that
we
have
resumed
business,"
remarked
Nattie,
with
a
grin.

"It
will
be
unpleasant
news
to
some,"
replied
his
brother,
dryly.
"If
we
have
the
success
I
anticipate
I
wouldn't
be
astonished
if
we
found
the
whole
crew
banded
against
us.
Black
&
Company
can
influence
the
three
German
houses
and
probably
others."

Nattie
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
air
in
defiance.
They
presently
came
to
a
_jinrikisha_
stand,
and
selecting
two
vehicles
promising
comfort,
were
soon
whirling
away
homeward.
The
distance
to
the
suburb
on
the
heights
where
the
Mannings
lived
was
fully
three
_ris_,
or
more
than
six
miles,
but
the
_karumayas_
made
little
of
the
task.

These
men,
the
"cab
horses"
of
Japan,
clad
in
their
short
tunics,
straw
sandals,
and
huge
mushroom-shaped
hats
of
the
same
material,
possess
wonderful
energy.
They
think
nothing
of
a
couple
of
miles
at
full
speed,
and
the
apparently
careless
manner
in
which
they
tread
their
way
through
mazes
of
crowded
streets
is
awe-inspiring
to
the
foreign
visitor.

It
was
an
old
story
to
Grant
and
Nattie,
however,
and
they
leaned
back
against
the
soft
cushions
in
comfort.
After
passing
the
custom
house
the
_karumayas_
turned
into
the
Japanese
town.
Here
the
scene
changed
instantly.

Here
the
broad
roads
dwindled
to
narrow
lanes
lined
with
quaint
wooden
shops,
apparently
half
paper-glazed
windows.
Broad
banners
bearing
the
peculiar
native
characters
fluttered
in
the
breeze.
Here
and
there
could
be
seen
the
efforts
of
an
enterprising
Japanese
merchant
to
attract
trade
by
means
of
enormous
signs
done
in
comical
English.

The
_'rikishas_
whirled
past
crowded
_sake_,
or
wine
shops,
with
red-painted
tubs
full
of
queer
liquor;
past
crockery
stores
with
stock
displayed
on
the
floors;
past
tea
houses
from
which
came
the
everlasting
strains
of
the
_samisen_
and
_koto_;
on,
on,
at
full
speed
until
at
last
a
broad
open
way
was
gained
which
led
to
the
heights.

Espying
a
native
newsboy
trotting
by
with
his
tinkling
bell
attached
to
his
belt,
Nattie
called
him,
and
purchased
a
copy
of
the
English
paper,
the
Japan
_Mail_.

"I'll
see
what
Brinkley
has
to
say
about
the
trade,"
he
smiled.
"To-day's
work
has
interested
me
in
the
prices
of
tea,
and
machinery,
and
cotton
goods,
and
all
of
that
class
of
truck.
Hello!
raw
silk
has
gone
up
several
cents.
Rice
is
stationary,
and
tea
is
a
trifle
cheaper."

"That's
good,"
called
out
Grant
from
the
other
_'rikisha_.
"I
can
see
my
way
to
a
good
cargo
for
San
Francisco
if
this
deal
with
Mori
comes
to
pass.
Any
mention
made
of
purchases?"

"Black
&
Company
are
down
for
a
full
cargo
of
woollen
and
cotton
goods,
and
the
Berlin
Importing
Company
advertise
a
thousand
barrels
of
flour
by
next
steamer."

"We
can
beat
them
on
prices.
They
have
to
buy
through
a
middle
man,
and
we
have
a
contract
straight
with
Minneapolis.
I'll
see
what----"

"Jove!
here's
something
that
touches
me
more
than
musty
contracts,"
interrupted
Nattie,
eagerly
scanning
the
paper.
"The
Committee
on
Sports
of
the
Strangers'
Club
intend
to
hold
a
grand
celebration
on
the
seventh
of
July
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
Commodore
Perry's
arrival
in
the
Bay
of
Yeddo,
and
the
first
wedge
in
the
opening
of
Japan
to
the
commerce
of
the
foreign
world.
Subscriptions
are
asked."

"We
will
give
five
hundred
dollars,"
promptly
replied
Grant.
"In
a
case
like
this
we
must
not
be
backward."

"That's
good
policy.
You
hold
up
the
honor
of
our
house
at
that
end,
and
I'll
see
that
we
don't
suffer
in
the
field."

"What
do
you
mean?"

"Why,
there
are
to
be
athletic
sports
galore,"
chuckled
Nattie,
in
high
glee.
"A
very
novel
programme
is
to
be
arranged.
It
will
consist
of
ancient
Japanese
games
and
modern
European
matches.
There
is
to
be
a
grand
wrestling
contest
among
the
foreign
residents.
That
suits
me
clear
down
to
the
ground.
And
the
funny
thing
about
it
is
that
no
one
is
to
know
the
name
of
his
antagonist
until
he
enters
the
ring."

"That
will
certainly
add
to
the
interest."

"I
should
say
so.
I
am
going
to
send
my
name
in
to
the
secretary
to-morrow.
Let
me
see;
this
is
the
second
of
July.
That
means
four
days
for
practice.
I'll
secure
old
Matsu
Doi
as
a
trainer.
Whoop!
there
will
be
loads
of
fun,
and--what
under
the
sun
is
the
matter?"

Grant
had
arisen
in
his
_'rikisha_
and
was
staring
back
at
a
shabby-appearing
native
house
they
had
just
passed.
For
the
purpose
of
taking
a
short
cut
to
the
road
leading
up
the
bluff
the
_karumayas_
had
turned
into
a
squalid
part
of
the
native
town.
The
streets
were
narrow
and
winding,
the
buildings
lining
them
mere
shells
of
unpainted
wood.

"What
is
the
matter?"
repeated
Nattie,
stopping
the
carriage.

Instead
of
replying,
Grant
tumbled
from
his
_jinrikisha_
with
surprising
agility,
and
stepped
behind
a
screen
in
front
of
a
rice
shop.
Then
he
beckoned
to
his
mystified
brother,
and
with
a
peremptory
gesture
ordered
the
_karumayas_
to
continue
on
up
the
street.




CHAPTER
IV.

THE
ATTACK
OF
THE
RONINS.


"What
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you?"
repeated
Nattie,
for
the
third
time.
"What
have
you
seen?"

"Sh-h-h!
there
he
is
now,"
replied
Grant,
peeping
out
from
behind
the
screen.
"I
thought
as
much."

The
younger
lad
followed
his
brother's
example,
and
peered
forth.
A
few
rods
down
the
crooked
street
was
a
small
tea
house
which
bore
the
worst
reputation
of
any
in
Yokohama.
It
was
noted
as
being
the
resort
for
a
class
of
dissolute
Samurai,
or
Ronins,
as
they
are
generally
termed.

These
men,
relics
of
the
Ancient
Order
of
Warriors,
are
scattered
over
the
country
in
cities
and
towns.
Some
have
finally
exchanged
the
sword
for
the
scales
or
plowshare,
but
there
are
others
wedded
to
a
life
of
arrogant
ease,
who
have
refused
to
work.

Too
proud
to
beg,
they
are
reduced
to
one
recourse--thievery
and
ruffianism.
The
strict
police
laws
of
Japan
keep
them
in
general
control,
but
many
midnight
robberies
and
assassinations
are
properly
laid
to
their
door.

On
glancing
from
his
place
of
concealment,
Nattie
saw
three
men,
whose
dress
and
air
of
fierce
brutality
proclaimed
them
as
Ronins,
emerge
from
the
tea
house.

They
were
immediately
followed
by
a
stocky-built
young
man,
clad
in
English
costume.
It
was
Ralph
Black.
He
cast
a
cautious
glance
up
and
down
the
street,
then
set
out
at
a
rapid
walk
for
the
Bund,
or
foreign
settlement.

Nattie
gave
a
low
whistle
of
surprise.

"Well,
I
declare!"
he
exclaimed.
"Is
it
possible
he
has
fallen
so
low
as
to
frequent
such
a
place?"

"I
hardly
think
so,"
replied
Grant.

"What
was
he
doing
in
there,
then?"

"I
will
tell
you.
He
is
out
of
sight
now.
Come,
we'll
catch
up
with
the
_'rikishas_.
When
we
were
passing
that
tea
house
I
chanced
to
look
through
the
window.
Imagine
my
surprise
when
I
saw
Ralph
engaged
in
close
conversation
with
a
villainous-looking
Ronin.
It
struck
me
at
once
that
something
was
up,
so
I
motioned
you
to
follow
me
from
the
carriages.
What
do
you
think
of
it?"

"It
is
deuced
queer."

"Ralph
Black
is
unscrupulous.
He
hates
both
of
us,
and
in
my
opinion
he
wouldn't
stop
at
anything
to
avenge
himself."

"Then
you
think?"

"That
he
is
arranging
to
have
us
assaulted
some
night
by
those
villainous
Ronins,"
replied
Grant,
gravely.

Nattie
halted,
and,
clinching
his
fists,
glanced
back
as
if
minded
to
return.

"If
I
thought
so
I'd
settle
it
now,"
he
said,
angrily.

"Nonsense.
What
could
you
do
in
a
row
with
three
or
four
cutthroats?
It
is
only
a
supposition
of
mine.
I
would
be
sorry
to
believe
that
even
Ralph
Black
would
conspire
in
such
a
cowardly
manner.
Still
we
should
keep
an
eye
out
during
the
next
week
or
so,
anyway.
Here
are
the
_'rikishas_.
Jump
in,
and
we'll
go
home."

The
balance
of
the
trip
to
the
bluff
was
made
without
incident.
By
the
time
the
Manning
residence
was
reached
the
incident
had
been
displaced
by
something
of
apparent
greater
importance.
Nattie's
mind
was
filled
with
thoughts
of
the
triumphs
he
intended
to
win
in
the
wrestling
match
on
the
seventh
of
July,
and
Grant
was
equally
well
occupied
in
the
impending
resurrection
of
the
importing
firm.

The
home
of
the
Mannings--that
occupied
by
them
in
summer--was
a
typical
Japanese
house.
It
was
low
and
squat,
consisted
of
one
story
only,
and
the
walls
were
of
hard
wood
eked
out
with
bamboo
ornaments.
The
numerous
windows
were
glazed
with
oiled
paper,
and
the
roof
was
constructed
of
tiles
painted
a
dark
red.
The
grounds
surrounding
the
structure
were
spacious,
and
in
the
rear
stretched
a
garden
abloom
with
richly-colored
native
plants.
Ancient
trees,
maple,
weeping
willow,
and
fir
afforded
ample
shade
from
the
afternoon
sun,
and
here
and
there
were
scattered
stone
vases
and
Shinto
images.
A
moderately-sized
lake
occupied
the
center
of
the
garden.

Ranging
along
the
front
of
the
house
was
a
raised
balcony
to
which
led
a
short
flight
of
steps.
Ascending
to
this,
the
boys
removed
their
shoes,
exchanging
them
for
straw
sandals.
Passing
through
an
open
door,
they
entered
the
front
room
of
the
dwelling.

A
servant
clad
in
white
garments
immediately
prostrated
himself
and
awaited
the
commands
of
his
masters.
Grant
briefly
ordered
dinner
served
at
once.
Other
servants
appeared,
and
by
the
shifting
of
a
couple
of
panels
(Japanese
walls
are
movable)
the
apartment
was
enlarged.

The
floor
was
of
matting--delicate
stuffed
wicker
an
inch
thick,
and
of
spotless
hue--and
the
entire
room
was
devoid
of
either
chair
or
table.
To
an
American
boy
the
preparations
for
dinner
would
have
been
surprising,
to
say
the
least.
But
Grant
and
Nattie
were
thoroughly
conversant
with
native
styles,
and
the
only
emotion
they
displayed
was
eager
anticipation.

In
lieu
of
tables
were
two
little
boxes
about
a
foot
square,
the
lids
of
which
were
lifted
and
laid
on
the
body
of
the
box,
with
the
inner
surface
up.
This
was
japanned
red,
and
the
sides
of
the
box
a
soft
blue.
Inside
were
stored
rice
bowl,
vegetable
dish,
and
chopstick
case.

At
the
announcement
of
the
meal,
Grant
and
his
brother
seated
themselves
upon
the
floor
and
prepared
to
partake
of
the
food
set
before
them
with
equally
as
much
appetite
as
if
the
feast
had
been
spread
in
American
fashion.

Both
boys
had
lived
the
most
of
their
youthful
lives
in
Japan,
and
they
had
fallen
into
the
quaint
ways
of
the
people
with
the
adaptability
of
the
young.
Mr.
Manning
had
early
taken
unto
himself
the
literal
meaning
of
the
old
saw,
"When
you
are
in
Rome,
do
as
the
Romans
do,"
and
his
sons
had
dutifully
followed
his
example.

After
dinner
the
boys
sat
for
a
while
on
the
front
balcony,
and
then
prepared
for
the
theatre.
_Jinrikishas_
were
summoned,
and
a
rapid
journey
made
to
the
home
of
native
acting
in
Yokohama.

The
peculiarity
of
Japanese
theatricals
is
that
a
play
generally
commences
in
the
morning,
and
lasts
until
late
at
night.
For
this
reason
our
heroes
found
the
building
comfortably
filled
with
parties
at
that
moment
eating
their
simple
evening
repast.

The
theatre
was
a
large
square
structure,
situated
in
the
center
of
a
small
park.
The
interior
was
decorated
with
innumerable
paper
lanterns,
and
covering
the
walls
were
enormous,
gaudily-painted
banners
setting
forth
in
Japanese
characters
the
fame
of
the
performers.

The
stage
filled
one
entire
side,
and
was
equipped
with
a
curtain
similar
to
those
found
in
American
theatres.
There
were
no
wings,
however,
and
no
exit
except
through
the
auditorium.
On
the
remaining
three
sides
were
balconies,
and
near
the
ceiling
was
a
familiar
gallery
filled
with
the
native
small
boys.

The
floor
was
barren
of
chairs,
being
divided
into
square
pens,
each
holding
four
people.
The
partitions
were
one
foot
in
height,
and
elevated
gangways
traversed
the
theatre
at
intervals,
permitting
of
the
passage
of
the
audience
to
their
respective
boxes.

As
usual
in
all
Japanese
structures,
the
spectators
removed
their
shoes
at
the
entrance,
being
provided
with
sandals
by
the
management
for
the
time
being.
The
last
act
of
the
drama
was
commenced
shortly
after
the
boys
reached
their
inclosure,
and
it
proceeded
without
intermission
until
ten
o'clock.

Grant
and
Nattie
left
ten
minutes
before
the
end
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
crowd.
There
were
a
number
of
people
in
front
of
the
building
and
innumerable
_'rikishas_
with
their
attendant
_karumayas_.
As
the
boys
emerged
from
the
door
they
were
accosted
by
two
men
dressed
as
coolies.
Each
exhibited
a
comfortable
carriage,
and
their
services
were
accepted
without
question.

"What
shall
it
be,
home?"
asked
Nattie,
with
a
yawn.

"Yes,
we
may
as
well
return.
There
is
nothing
going
on
in
town"
replied
Grant.
"I
have
a
little
writing
to
do,
anyway."

Stepping
into
his
vehicle,
he
bade
the
man
make
good
time
to
the
bluff.
Both
boys
were
preoccupied,
and
they
paid
little
attention
to
the
crowd
through
which
they
passed.
They
also
failed
to
see
a
signal
given
by
one
of
the
supposed
_karumayas_
to
a
group
of
three
natives
standing
near
the
corner
of
the
theatre.

The
easy
swinging
motion
of
the
_jinrikishas_
lulled
their
occupants
to
rest,
and
both
Grant
and
his
brother
were
on
the
verge
of
dozing
before
a
dozen
blocks
had
been
covered.

The
night
was
dark,
it
being
the
hour
before
the
appearance
of
a
new
moon.
Thick
clouds
also
added
to
the
obscurity,
blotting
out
even
the
feeble
rays
of
the
starry
canopy.
A
feeling
of
rain
was
in
the
air.

Down
in
the
quarter
where
lay
the
foreign
settlement
a
soft
glow
came
from
the
electric
lights.
The
deep-toned
note
of
a
steamer's
whistle
sounded
from
the
bay.
The
bell
of
a
modern
clock
tolled
the
half
hour,
and
before
the
echoing
clangor
had
died
away
the
two
_'rikishas_
carrying
the
boys
came
to
a
sudden
stop.

Nattie
aroused
himself
with
a
start
and
glanced
around
half
angrily
at
being
disturbed.
Before
he
could
utter
a
protest
or
ask
the
reason
for
the
halt
both
coolies
unceremoniously
disappeared
into
a
neighboring
house.

Grant
had
barely
time
to
notice
that
they
were
in
a
narrow
way
devoid
of
lanterns,
when
there
came
a
rush
of
footsteps
from
behind,
and
three
dark
figures
made
an
attack
upon
the
carriage.

There
was
a
vicious
whiz
of
a
heavy
sound,
and
the
right
edge
of
Nattie's
_'rikisha_
body
was
neatly
lopped
off.
The
crashing
of
wood
brought
the
boys
to
a
realization
of
their
position.
They
knew
at
once
that
they
were
being
attacked
by
thugs.

With
an
exclamation
of
excitement,
Nattie
leaped
from
his
carriage.
Another
spring,
and
he
was
close
to
Grant.
Then,
with
incredible
quickness,
the
resolute
lad
produced
a
revolver
from
an
inner
pocket
and
fired
point-blank
at
the
nearest
Ronin.

CHAPTER
V.

THE
MAN
WITH
THE
GLADSTONE
BAG.


The
extreme
gloom
and
the
excitement
of
the
moment
caused
Nattie
to
aim
badly,
and
the
bullet
whizzed
past
the
object
for
which
it
was
intended,
striking
the
ground
several
paces
away
instead.
The
shot
had
one
result,
however.

It
caused
the
assailants
to
hesitate.
One
even
started
to
retreat,
but
he
was
checked
by
a
guttural
word
from
the
evident
leader.
The
slight
delay
was
instantly
taken
advantage
of
by
the
boys.
Still
holding
his
weapon
in
readiness
for
use,
Nattie
hurriedly
wheeled
both
_'rikishas_
between
them
and
the
Ronins.

Thus
a
barricade
was
formed
behind
which
Grant
and
Nattie
sought
refuge
without
loss
of
time.
As
yet,
not
a
word
had
been
exchanged.
In
fact,
the
events
had
occurred
in
much
less
time
than
it
takes
to
describe
them.
Now
Grant
took
occasion
to
remark
in
tones
of
deep
conviction:

"This
is
Ralph
Black's
work,
Nattie.
It
is
the
sequel
to
my
discovery
of
him
in
that
low
tea
house
this
afternoon.
He
has
bribed
these
cutthroats
to
assault
us."

"No
doubt.
But
we
can't
stop
to
probe
the
why
and
wherefore
now.
They
intend
to
attack
us
again.
It's
a
good
job
I
brought
this
gun
with
me
to-night.
I
have
six
shots
left,
and
I'll
put
them
to
use
if--look
out!
they
are
coming!"

While
speaking,
he
noticed
something
stealthily
advancing
through
the
darkness.
He
took
rapid
aim,
but
before
he
could
pull
the
trigger
he
was
struck
upon
the
shoulder
by
a
stone
which
came
from
in
front.
The
force
of
the
blow
was
sufficient
to
send
him
staggering
against
one
of
the
_'rikishas_.
He
dropped
the
revolver,
but
it
was
snatched
up
by
Grant.

The
lame
youth
instantly
used
it,
firing
hastily
through
the
wheel
of
one
of
the
carriages.
A
shrill
cry
of
pain
came
from
the
shadows,
then
a
loud
shout
sounded
at
the
lower
end
of
the
street.
Twinkling
lights
appeared,
and
then
echoing
footsteps
indicated
that
relief
was
at
hand.

The
thugs
were
not
slow
in
realizing
that
retreat
was
advisable
under
the
circumstances.
They
gave
the
boys
a
parting
volley
of
stones,
then
all
three
disappeared
into
an
adjacent
house.

"Are
you
injured,
brother?"
anxiously
asked
Grant,
bending
over
Nattie.

"No;
a
bruise,
that's
all.
The
police
are
coming
at
last,
eh?
They
must
have
heard
the
shots.
What
are
you
going
to
say
about
this
affair?
Will
you
mention
your
suspicions?"

"No;
it
would
be
useless.
We
have
no
proof
that
he
set
these
men
upon
us.
We
must
bide
our
time
and
watch
the
scamp.
Hush!
they
are
here."

A
squad
of
Japanese
police,
carrying
lanterns,
dashed
up
at
a
run.
Their
leader,
a
sub-lieutenant,
wearing
a
uniform
similar
to
that
of
a
French
gendarme,
flashed
his
light
over
the
capsized
_'rikishas_
and
their
late
occupants;
then
he
asked
the
cause
of
the
trouble
in
a
respectful
tone.

"We
have
been
waylaid
and
attacked
by
three
Ronins
bent
on
robbery,"
replied
Grant,
in
the
native
tongue.
"We
were
on
our
way
home
from
the
theatre
and
while
passing
through
this
street
were
set
upon
and
almost
murdered."

"Which
way
did
the
scoundrels
go?"
hastily
queried
the
lieutenant.

"Through
that
house.
The
_karumayas_
fled
in
that
direction
also."

Leaving
two
of
his
men
with
the
boys,
the
leader
started
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives.
No
time
was
wasted
in
knocking
for
admission.
One
of
the
policemen
placed
his
shoulder
to
the
door
and
forced
it
back
without
much
effort.

A
moment
later
the
sounds
of
crashing
partitions
and
a
glare
of
light
from
within
indicated
that
a
strict
search
was
being
carried
on.
Grant
and
Nattie
waited
a
moment;
then
the
latter
said:

"Suppose
we
go
home.
We
might
hang
around
here
for
hours.
If
they
catch
the
rascals
they
can
call
for
us
at
the
house."

Grant
favored
the
suggestion.
He
told
one
of
the
policemen
to
inform
the
lieutenant
of
their
address,
then
he
and
his
brother
secured
a
couple
of
_'rikishas_
in
an
adjacent
street,
and
were
soon
home
once
more.
The
excitement
of
the
night
attack
had
driven
sleep
from
them,
so
they
remained
out
upon
the
cool
balcony
and
discussed
the
events
of
the
day
until
a
late
hour.

After
viewing
the
situation
from
all
sides,
it
was
finally
decided
that
a
waiting
policy
should
prevail.
To
boldly
accuse
Ralph
Black
of
such
a
nefarious
plot
without
stronger
proof
was
out
of
the
question.

"If
any
of
the
Ronins
or
the
_karumayas_
are
captured,
they
may
be
induced
to
confess,"
said
Grant.
"In
that
case
we
can
do
something.
Otherwise,
we
will
have
to
bide
our
time."

Both
boys
arose
early
on
the
following
morning
and
started
for
the
office
immediately
after
breakfast.
They
called
in
at
the
main
police
station
on
their
way
downtown
and
learned
that
nothing
had
been
seen
of
the
Ronins
or
_jinrikisha_
men.

The
officer
in
charge
promised
to
have
the
city
scoured
for
the
wretches,
and
apologized
profusely
for
the
outrage.
On
reaching
the
office,
Grant
called
in
several
coolies
and
set
them
to
work
cleaning
up
the
interior.
By
noon
the
counting-room
had
lost
its
former
appearance
of
neglect.
The
desks
and
other
furniture
were
dusted,
the
books
put
in
order,
and
everything
arranged
for
immediate
work.

At
the
"tiffin,"
or
midday
lunch
hour,
the
brothers
dropped
in
at
a
well-known
restaurant
on
Main
Street.
As
they
entered
the
front
door
a
youth
arose
hastily
from
a
table
in
the
center
and
disappeared
through
a
side
entrance.
It
was
Ralph
Black.

"If
that
don't
signify
guilt,
I'm
a
chicken,"
remarked
Nattie,
with
a
grim
smile.
"He's
a
fool."

"All
he
needs
is
rope
enough,"
replied
Grant,
in
the
same
tone,
"and
he
will
save
us
the
trouble
of
hanging
him.
I
suppose
he
was
ashamed
or
afraid
to
face
us
after
last
night's
treacherous
work."

On
returning
to
the
counting-room
they
found
the
young
Japanese,
Mori,
awaiting
them.
To
say
that
he
was
cordially
greeted
is
but
half
the
truth.
There
was
an
expression
upon
his
face
that
promised
success,
and
Nattie
wrung
his
hand
until
the
genial
native
begged
him
to
desist.

"My
answer
is
ready,"
he
announced,
producing
a
bundle
of
papers.
"I
suppose
you
are
anxious
to
know
what
it
is?"

"You
don't
need
to
tell
us,"
chuckled
Nattie,
"I
can
read
it
in
your
eyes.
Shake,
old
boy!
Success
to
the
new
firm!"

"You
have
guessed
aright,"
said
Mori.
"And
I
echo
with
all
my
heart
what
you
say.
Success
to
the
new
firm
of
Manning
Brothers
&
Okuma.
If
you
will
come
with
me
to
your
consul
we
will
ratify
the
contract
without
loss
of
time."

Grant's
eyes
were
moist
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
young
Japanese.

"You
are
indeed
a
friend,"
he
exclaimed,
fervently.
"You
will
lose
nothing
by
it,
I
assure
you.
If
hard
work
and
constant
application
to
duty
will
bring
us
success,
I
will
guarantee
that
part
of
it."

An
hour
later
the
newly-formed
firm
of
importers
and
traders
was
an
acknowledged
fact.
In
the
presence
of
the
American
Consul
as
a
witness,
Mori
paid
into
the
foreign
bank
the
sum
of
twenty
thousand
dollars,
and
Grant,
as
his
late
father's
executor,
turned
over
to
the
firm
the
various
contracts
and
the
mortgages
on
the
warehouse
and
office
building.

"The
very
first
thing
we
must
see
about
is
that
debt
of
Black
&
Company,"
announced
the
lame
youth.
"It
won't
do
to
have
the
new
firm
sued.
We
will
call
at
their
office
now
and
pay
it
under
a
written
protest."

"Yes,
and
deposit
their
receipt
in
the
bank,"
added
Nattie,
grimly.

"Nothing
was
found
of
the
first
receipt?"
asked
Mori,
as
they
left
the
consulate.

"Not
a
sign.
I
have
searched
through
all
the
papers
in
the
office,
but
without
result.
There
is
some
mystery
about
it.
Father
never
was
very
orderly
in
keeping
documents,
but
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
he
would
mislay
a
paper
of
that
value."

"Who
was
in
the
office
when
your
father--er--when
the
sad
end
came?"

"Three
clerks
under
the
charge
of
a
bookkeeper
named
Willis
Round.
Mr.
Round
was
seated
at
a
desk
next
to
father's
at
the
moment.
I
was
in
the
outer
office."

"Was
your
father
lying
upon
the
floor
when
you
were
called?"
asked
Mori;
then
he
added,
hastily:
"Forgive
me
if
I
pain
you,
Grant.
Perhaps
we
had
better
allow
the
subject
to
drop."

"No,
no.
I
see
what
you
are
driving
at.
You
think
that
possibly
Mr.
Round
may
have
stolen
the
receipt?"

"Exactly.
Take
a
case
like
that;
a
valuable
paper
and
an
unscrupulous
man
within
easy
reach,
and
you
can
easily
see
what
would
happen.
I
don't
remember
this
Mr.
Round.
What
kind
of
a
man
was
he?"

"I
never
liked
him,"
spoke
up
Nattie.
"He
had
a
sneaking
face,
and
was
always
grinning
to
himself,
as
if
he
had
the
laugh
on
other
people.
Then
I
saw
him
kick
a
poor
dog
one
day,
and
a
man
who
would
do
that
is
not
to
be
trusted."

"I
guess
you
are
right,"
agreed
Grant.
"Come
to
think
of
it,
I
never
liked
Mr.
Round
myself.
He
was
a
thorough
bookkeeper
though,
and
knew
his
business."

"Where
is
he
now?"
asked
Mori.

"I
think
he
left
for
England.
He
was
an
Englishman,
you
know.
After
our
firm
closed
he
waited
around
town
for
a
while,
then
I
heard
somebody
say
he
returned
to
London."

The
office
of
Black
&
Company
was
on
the
Bund,
only
a
few
squares
from
the
consulate,
so
the
boys
walked
there
instead
of
taking
the
omnipresent
_jinrikishas_.
The
building
was
a
dingy
structure
of
one
story,
and
bore
the
usual
sign
over
the
door.

As
Grant
and
his
companions
entered
the
outer
office
a
tall,
thin
man,
carrying
a
much-worn
Gladstone
bag,
brushed
past
them
and
vanished
down
the
street.
The
lame
youth
glanced
at
the
fellow's
face,
then
he
turned
to
Nattie
with
a
low
whistle.

"There's
a
queer
thing,"
he
said.
"If
that
man
wore
side
whiskers,
I
would
wager
anything
that
he
was
Mr.
Willis
Round
himself."




CHAPTER
VI.

MR.
BLACK
RECEIVES
A
SURPRISE.


"You
don't
say?"
ejaculated
the
lad,
stopping
near
the
door.
"Why,
perhaps
it
was.
Wait,
I'll
follow
him
and
see."

Before
either
Grant
or
Mori
could
offer
an
objection,
Nattie
darted
from
the
office
into
the
street.
There
were
several
clerks
in
the
counting-room,
and
they
eyed
the
newcomers
curiously.
At
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
a
door
leading
into
the
private
office
of
the
firm.

A
hum
of
voices
came
from
within.
Grant
waited
a
moment
undecided
what
to
do,
then
he
approached
a
clerk,
and
asked
him
to
announce
to
Mr.
Black
that
Grant
Manning
wished
to
see
him
on
important
business.
The
message
produced
immediate
results.

The
fellow
had
hardly
disappeared
when
the
senior
member
himself
stalked
majestically
into
the
outer
apartment.
Waving
an
official
document
in
one
hand,
he
glowered
at
the
lame
youth
and
exclaimed,
in
a
harsh
voice:

"Your
call
will
do
you
no
good,
sir.
I
have
already
instituted
the
suit.
I
suppose
you
have
come
to
beg
for
time,
as
usual?"

"You
suppose
wrong,
sir,"
coldly
replied
Grant.

"Well,
what
is
the
object
of
this
visit,
then?"

"Please
make
out
a
receipt
for
the
full
amount
of
our
debt."

Mr.
Black's
face
expressed
the
liveliest
amazement.
The
door
leading
to
the
inner
office
creaked,
and
Ralph's
familiar
countenance
appeared
in
the
opening.
It
was
evident
that
he
had
been
listening.

"W-h-hat
did
you
say?"
gasped
the
merchant.

"Please
make
out
a
receipt
in
full
for
the
money
owed
to
you
by
the
firm
of
Manning
&
Company,"
repeated
Grant,
calmly.

"Then
you
mean
to
pay
it?"

"Yes."

"But
how
can
you?
It
is
over
fifty-eight
hundred
dollars,
boy."

"Five
thousand,
eight
hundred
and
fifty
dollars,
in
round
numbers,"
replied
the
lame
youth,
in
a
businesslike
voice.
"The
receipt,
please.
I
will
draw
you
a
check
for
the
amount
at
once."

He
drew
a
small
book
from
his
pocket,
and
proceeded
to
write
the
figures
as
if
such
items
were
mere
bagatelles
in
his
business.
Mori,
who
had
been
an
interested
but
silent
spectator
now
stepped
forward
and
whispered
a
few
words
to
Grant.
The
latter
nodded,
and
said,
again
addressing
Mr.
Black:

"By
the
way,
sir,
I
think
you
had
better
accompany
me
to
the
American
or
English
consulate.
In
view
of
past
happenings,
I
prefer
to
have
a
reputable
witness
to
this
payment."

The
merchant's
face
flushed
a
deep
red,
and
then
paled
again.
Before
he
could
reply,
Ralph
emerged
from
the
inner
office
and
advanced
toward
Grant
with
his
hands
clinched
and
a
threatening
look
upon
his
dark
countenance.

"What
do
you
mean,
you
scoundrel?"
he
stormed.
"Do
you
dare
to
insult
my
father
in
his
own
office?
I've
a
notion
to----"

He
broke
off
abruptly
and
lowered
his
hands.
Mori
had
stepped
before
Grant
in
a
manner
there
was
no
mistaking.
The
young
Japanese
was
small
of
stature,
but
there
was
an
air
of
muscular
solidity
about
him
which
spoke
eloquently
of
athletic
training.

"No
threats,
Ralph
Black,"
he
exclaimed,
coolly.
"We
are
here
on
a
matter
of
business
with
your
father.
Please
remember
that
you
have
to
deal
with
me
as
well
as
Mr.
Manning."

"What
have
you
to
do
with
it?"
grated
the
youth.
"Mind
your
own
business."

"That
is
exactly
what
I
am
doing,"
was
the
suave
reply.

"Enough
of
this
contention,"
suddenly
exclaimed
Mr.
Black,
with
a
semblance
of
dignity.
"Ralph,
return
to
the
inner
office.
I
will
soon
settle
these
upstarts.
Simmons,
a
receipt
for
the
debt
owed
us
by
Manning."

The
latter
sentence
was
addressed
to
a
clerk,
who
promptly
came
forward
with
the
required
paper.
Taking
it,
the
merchant
extended
his
hand
for
the
check.
Grant
hesitated
and
glanced
at
Mori.
That
youth
nodded
his
head,
and
whispered:

"We
may
as
well
waive
the
precaution
of
having
it
paid
before
the
consul.
The
receipt
will
answer
the
purpose.
There
are
two
of
us,
you
know."

"Well,
do
you
intend
to
pay?"
impatiently
demanded
Mr.
Black.

The
lame
youth
gave
him
the
check
without
deigning
to
reply.
The
merchant
glanced
at
the
amount,
then
he
eyed
the
signature
in
evident
surprise.

"What
does
this
mean?"
he
asked,
harshly.
"This
is
signed
'Manning
Brothers
&
Okuma.'
What
absurdity
is
this?"

"It
means
what
it
says,
sir,"
answered
Grant,
a
suspicion
of
triumph
in
his
voice.
"I
may
as
well
tell
you
what
Yokohama
will
know
before
night.
The
importing
and
trading
firm
of
Manning
&
Company
has
been
revived.
Mr.
Okuma
here
is
a
partner
in
the
house,
and
we
commence
business
at
once.
You
act
as
if
you
do
not
believe
me,
sir.
Please
satisfy
yourself
by
sending
to
the
foreign
bank."

As
it
happened,
at
that
moment
a
clerk
from
the
bank
in
question
entered
the
office
with
some
papers.
A
brief
question
addressed
to
him
by
the
merchant
brought
instant
proof
of
the
lame
youth's
words.
As
if
dazed,
Mr.
Black
gave
him
the
receipt
and
entered
the
inner
office
without
a
word.
Grant
and
Mori
left
at
once.

They
looked
up
and
down
the
street
for
Nattie,
but
he
was
not
in
sight.
After
waiting
for
several
moments
at
the
corner
they
set
out
for
the
counting-room.
The
young
Japanese
seemed
preoccupied
at
first
as
if
buried
in
thought,
but
he
finally
turned
to
his
companion
and
said:

"There
is
something
about
this
business
of
the
Black
debt
that
I
do
not
understand.
How
is
it
you
could
find
no
trace
of
the
payment
at
the
bank
or
among
your
canceled
checks?
It
would
surely
be
there."

"Why,
I
thought
I
had
explained
that
to
you,"
replied
Grant.
"The
money
paid
them
by
my
father
was
in
cash,
not
by
check.
I
remember
that
on
that
day
we
had
received
almost
six
thousand
dollars
in
English
gold
from
the
skipper
of
a
sailing
ship.
The
money
was
placed
in
the
small
safe."

"And
it
was
gone
when
you
examined
the
safe
after
your
father's
death?"

"Exactly.
That
is
why
I
am
so
positive
the
debt
was
paid.
That
fact
and
the
unfinished
entry
in
father's
book
is
proof
enough."

"It
certainly
is,"
replied
Mori,
with
conviction.
"Well,
something
may
turn
up
in
time
to
establish
the
fact.
Here
is
the
office.
We
will
wait
until
Nattie
returns."

In
the
meantime
an
important
scene
had
taken
place
in
the
counting-room
they
had
just
left.
After
their
departure,
Mr.
Black
cleared
his
private
apartment
of
his
secretary
and
closing
the
door
leading
to
the
outer
room,
bade
his
son
draw
a
chair
up
to
the
desk.

The
merchant's
face
appeared
grim
and
determined.
He
nervously
arranged
a
pile
of
papers
before
him,
and
then,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
recently
heard
unpleasant
news,
he
confronted
Ralph.

"Did
you
hear
what
that
crippled
whelp
said?"
he
asked.

"Yes,"
sullenly
replied
his
son.
"He's
induced
Mori
Okuma
to
go
in
with
him,
and
they
intend
to
commence
business
at
once."

"Do
you
know
what
that
means
to
us?"

"Another
rival,
I
suppose.
Well,
we
needn't
be
afraid
of
them."

"Zounds!
you
can
be
stupid
at
times,
sir.
We
have
every
reason
to
be
alarmed
at
the
formation
of
the
new
firm.
If
you
paid
more
attention
to
the
affairs
of
Black
&
Company
and
less
to
running
around
with
the
sports
of
Yokohama,
you
would
be
of
more
assistance
to
me."

"What
is
the
matter
now?"
snarled
the
youth,
arising
from
his
chair.
"These
rows
are
getting
too
frequent,
and
I
won't
stand
it.
I
am
no
baby
to
be
reproved
by
you
whenever
you
please.
I
won't----"

"Sit
down!"
thundered
the
merchant.
"Don't
be
a
fool."
Then
he
added,
more
mildly:
"Remember
that
I
am
your
father,
Ralph.
It
is
sometimes
necessary
to
reprove
you
as
you
must
acknowledge.
But
enough
of
that
now.
We
have
a
more
weighty
subject
to
discuss.
You
evidently
do
not
see
what
this
new
firm
means
to
us.
I
can
explain
in
a
few
words.
You
have
doubtless
heard
rumors
of
trouble
with
China
about
Corea?"

"Yes,
but
that
is
an
old
tale.
I
heard
it
two
years
past."

"Well,
there
is
more
truth
in
it
now
than
you
believe.
I
have
private
means
of
obtaining
information.
If
I
am
not
mistaken
we
will
have
war
before
the
end
of
the
present
year."

"What
of
it?"

The
merchant
held
up
his
hands
in
evident
disgust.

"It
is
easy
to
be
seen
that
you
have
little
of
the
instincts
of
a
merchant
in
you,"
he
said,
bitterly.
"Hold!
I
do
not
intend
to
reprove
you.
I
will
not
waste
the
time.
If
you
don't
know,
I
will
tell
you
that
war
means
the
expenditure
of
money,
and
the
purchase
of
arms
and
stores.
I
know
that
the
government
is
preparing
for
the
coming
conflict,
and
that
they
need
guns
and
ammunition
and
canned
provisions."

"Why
don't
you
try
for
the
contracts
then?"

"I
intend
to.
As
you
may
remember,
that
little
affair
of
the
fodder
last
year
for
the
cavalry
horses
has
hurt
my
credit
with
the
war
department.
I
think
I
still
stand
a
show,
however--if
there
are
no
other
bidders."

"How
about
the
German
firms?"

"Their
rivalry
won't
amount
to
anything,
but
if
this
Grant
Manning
comes
in
he
will
secure
the
contracts
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt.
Why,
he
is
hand-in-glove
with
Secretary
Yoshisada
Udono,
of
the
army.
The
Japanese
fool
thinks
Grant
is
the
soul
of
honesty,
and
the
cleverest
youth
in
Japan
besides."

Ralph
leaned
forward
in
his
chair,
and
pondered
deeply
for
a
moment.
Then,
tapping
the
desk
with
his
fingers,
he
said,
slowly,
and
with
emphasis:

"I
understand
the
case
now.
It
means
a
matter
of
thousands
of
pounds
to
us,
and
we
must
secure
the
contract,
come
what
will.
If
these
Manning
boys
stand
in
our
way
we
must
break
them,
that's
all.
One
thing,
we
have
a
good
ally
in
Willis
Round.
With
him
as----"

He
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
sound
at
the
door.
Before
either
could
move
it
was
thrown
open,
admitting
a
tall,
thin
man,
carrying
a
much-worn
Gladstone
bag.
Behind
him
and
almost
at
his
heels
was
Nattie
Manning,
an
expression
of
determination
upon
his
handsome
face.




CHAPTER
VII.

NATTIE
CARRIES
HIS
POINT.


When
Nattie
left
his
brother
and
Mori
in
the
office
of
Black
&
Company,
it
was
with
the
determination
to
ascertain
whether
the
tall,
thin
man
with
the
Gladstone
bag
was
really
the
late
bookkeeper,
Willis
Round.

If
the
lad
had
been
asked
why
he
was
placing
himself
to
so
much
trouble
for
such
a
purpose
he
could
not
have
answered.

There
was
no
reason
why
Round
should
not
return
to
Yokohama
if
he
so
minded.
And
he
had
every
right
to
remove
his
whiskers
if
he
chose
to
do
so;
and
again,
there
was
no
law
to
prevent
him
from
calling
upon
the
firm
of
Black
&
Company.

Still,
in
view
of
recent
circumstances,
it
seemed
suspicious
to
Nattie,
and
he
sped
down
the
street
with
the
firm
resolve
to
prove
the
identity
at
once.
As
the
reader
may
have
conjectured,
the
younger
Manning
brother
had
a
strong
will
of
his
own.

It
was
his
claim,
not
uttered
boastfully,
that
when
he
set
a
task
unto
himself,
he
generally
carried
it
out
if
the
thing
was
possible.
He
proved
that
characteristic
in
his
nature
in
the
present
instance.

On
reaching
the
corner
of
the
next
street,
which
happened
to
be
the
broad
thoroughfare
running
at
right
angles
from
the
Bund,
he
caught
sight
of
his
man
in
the
door
of
a
famous
tea
house
much
frequented
by
the
good
people
of
Yokohama.

The
fellow
had
paused,
and
was
glancing
back
as
if
suspicious
of
being
followed.
On
seeing
Nattie,
he
turned
quickly
and
disappeared
into
the
tea
house.
When
the
lad
reached
the
entrance,
he
found
the
front
room
untenanted
save
by
a
group
of
waiter
girls.

They
greeted
his
appearance
with
the
effusive
welcome
of
their
class,
but
he
brushed
them
aside
with
little
ceremony
and
passed
on
into
the
next
apartment.
This
also
was
empty.
The
more
imposing
tea
houses
of
Japan
are
generally
two-story
structures,
divided
into
a
multitude
of
small
and
large
rooms.

The
one
in
question
contained
no
less
than
a
round
dozen
on
the
ground
floor,
and
as
many
in
the
second
story.
There
was
no
central
hall,
but
simply
a
series
of
public
rooms
extending
from
front
to
rear,
with
private
apartments
opening
on
each
side.

Nattie
had
visited
the
place
times
out
of
mind,
and
he
knew
that
an
exit
could
be
found
in
the
rear
which
led
through
a
small
garden
to
a
gate,
opening
upon
a
back
street.
The
fact
caused
the
lad
to
hasten
his
steps.

While
hurrying
through
the
fourth
apartment,
he
heard
voices
in
a
side
room.
They
were
not
familiar,
but
he
halted
at
once.
Suppose
Round--if
it
were
he--should
take
it
into
his
head
to
enter
one
of
the
private
apartments?
He
could
easily
remain
concealed
until
a
sufficient
time
had
elapsed,
and
then
go
his
way
unseen.

For
a
brief
moment
Nattie
stood
irresolute.
If
he
remained
to
question
the
_matsumas_
it
would
give
the
evident
fugitive
time
to
escape
by
the
rear
gate.
And
if
he
hurried
through
the
garden
and
out
into
the
back
street,
Round
could
leave
by
the
main
entrance.

"Confound
it!
I
can't
stay
here
twirling
my
thumbs,"
he
exclaimed.
"What
shall
it
be,
back
gate
or
a
search
through
the
blessed
shanty?
I'll
leave
it
to
chance."

Thrusting
a
couple
of
fingers
into
a
vest
pocket,
he
extracted
an
American
quarter,
and
flipped
it
into
the
air.

"Heads,
I
search
these
rooms;
tails,
I
go
out
the
back
gate,"
he
murmured,
catching
the
descending
coin
with
great
dexterity.

"Tails
it
is.
Here
goes,
and
may
I
have
luck,"
he
added.

Hurrying
through
the
remaining
apartments,
he
vanished
into
the
garden
just
as
a
tall,
thin
man
carrying
a
Gladstone
bag
cautiously
opened
a
side
door
near
where
Nattie
had
juggled
the
coin.
There
was
a
bland
smile
upon
the
fellow's
face,
and
he
waved
one
hand
airily
after
the
youth.

"Ta,
ta,
Master
Manning,"
he
muttered.
"I
am
thankful
to
you
for
leaving
the
decision
to
a
piece
of
money.
It
was
a
close
call
for
me,
as
I
do
not
care
to
have
my
identity
guessed
just
at
present.
Now
that
the
coast
is
clear,
I'll
drop
in
on
the
Blacks
again
and
tell
them
to
be
careful."

Making
his
way
to
the
main
entrance,
he
called
a
passing
_'rikisha_
and
ordered
the
_karumaya_
to
carry
him
to
the
Bund
through
various
obscure
streets.
In
the
meantime,
Nattie
had
left
the
garden
by
way
of
the
rear
gate.
A
hurried
glance
up
and
down
the
narrow
thoroughfare
resulted
in
disappointment.

A
search
of
adjacent
streets
produced
nothing.
Considerably
crestfallen,
the
lad
returned
to
the
tea
house
and
questioned
the
head
of
the
establishment.
He
speedily
learned
to
his
chagrin
that
the
man
for
whom
he
had
been
searching
had
left
the
place
not
five
minutes
previously.

"Just
my
luck,"
he
murmured,
petulantly.
"Here,
Komatsu,
give
this
to
a
beggar;
it's
a
hoodoo."

The
affable
manager
accepted
the
ill-omened
twenty-five
cent
piece
with
many
bows
and
subsequently
placed
it
among
his
collection
of
rare
coins,
with
the
inscription:
"Yankee
Hoodoo.
Only
one
in
Yokohama.
Value,
ten
_yen_."

It
was
with
a
very
disconsolate
face
that
Nattie
left
the
tea
house
on
his
way
to
the
office
of
the
new
firm.
He
felt
positive
in
his
mind
that
the
thin
man
was
really
Willis
Round,
and
the
actions
of
the
fellow
in
slipping
away
so
mysteriously
tended
to
increase
the
lad's
suspicions.

"If
he
cared
to
return
to
Yokohama,
he
could
do
so,"
he
reasoned,
while
walking
down
Main
Street.
"It's
no
person's
business
that
I
can
see.
And
if
he
desired
to
increase
his
ugliness
by
shaving
off
his
whiskers
it
was
his
own
lookout.
But
what
I
don't
like
is
the
way
he
sneaked
out
of
Black's
counting-room
without
speaking
to
us.
He
was
certainly
trying
to
avoid
recognition,
and
that's
flat.

"I
wonder
what
he
had
to
do
with
that
debt?"
added
the
lad,
after
a
while.
"He
is
mixed
up
with
the
Blacks
in
some
way,
and
I'll
wager
the
connection
bodes
ill
to
some
one.
Perhaps
it
is
to
us."

He
had
reached
this
far
in
his
reflections
when
he
chanced
to
look
down
a
small
alley
leading
from
the
main
thoroughfare
to
a
public
garden.
A
_jinrikisha_
was
speeding
past
the
outlet.
The
vehicle
contained
one
man,
and
in
an
instant
Nattie
recognized
in
him
the
subject
of
his
thoughts.

To
cover
the
distance
to
the
garden
was
a
brief
task
for
the
lad's
nimble
feet.
As
he
emerged
from
the
alley,
however,
he
plumped
into
a
couple
of
American
man-of-war's
men.
The
collision
carried
one
of
them
into
the
gutter,
but
the
other
grasped
wildly
at
his
supposed
assailant's
collar.

(See
page
64)]

He
missed,
but
nothing
daunted,
the
sailor
started
in
pursuit,
calling
out
in
a
husky
voice
at
every
step.
In
his
eagerness
to
catch
up
with
Willis
Round,
Nattie
had
continued
his
flight.
The
hubbub
and
outcry
behind
him
soon
brought
him
to
a
halt,
and
he
faced
about
just
as
several
policemen
and
a
dozen
foreigners
and
native
citizens
joined
in
the
chase.

What
the
outcome
would
have
been
is
hard
to
say
had
not
help
arrived
at
that
opportune
moment
in
the
shape
of
a
friend--a
clerk
at
the
legation--who
suddenly
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
a
private
residence
within
a
dozen
feet
of
the
lad.

"What
is
the
matter,
Manning?"
hastily
asked
the
newcomer.

As
quick
as
a
flash
Nattie
bounded
past
him,
and
closed
the
door
just
as
the
infuriated
sailor
reached
the
spot.

"For
goodness'
sake,
old
fellow,
get
me
out
by
the
back
way!"
breathed
the
lad.
"I
haven't
time
to
explain
now.
I'll
tell
you
all
about
it
this
afternoon.
I
am
following
a
man,
and
I
mustn't
lose
him.
Let
me
out
by
the
rear,
please."

Considerably
mystified,
the
clerk
obeyed.
A
moment
later
Nattie
was
again
speeding
down
a
street
toward
the
Bund.
As
luck
would
have
it,
he
caught
sight
of
his
man
at
the
next
corner.
The
_jinrikisha_
had
stopped
in
front
of
Black
&
Company's
office.

Hurrying
ahead,
the
lad
contrived
to
enter
the
door
at
the
heels
of
the
fugitive.
He
stepped
lightly
across
the
counting-room,
and
was
within
a
foot
of
him
when
he
threw
open
the
door
leading
into
the
merchant's
private
office.

At
sight
of
them
both
Ralph
and
his
father
sprang
to
their
feet.
Totally
unsuspicious
of
the
proximity
of
his
pursuer,
the
tall,
thin
man
tossed
his
portmanteau
upon
a
chair,
and
was
on
the
point
of
greeting
the
occupants
of
the
office
when
he
saw
them
looking
behind
him
in
evident
surprise.

He
turned,
gave
Nattie
one
startled
glance,
then
made
an
involuntary
movement
as
if
contemplating
flight.
The
lad
barred
the
way,
however.
Grinning
triumphantly,
he
lifted
his
hat
with
a
polite
bow,
and
said:

"Why,
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure,
Mr.
Round.
I
did
not
know
you
had
returned
to
Yokohama.
How
is
everything
in
London?"

"What
are
you
talking
about?"
growled
the
fellow.
"I
don't
know
you."

"Indeed!
How
poor
your
memory
must
be.
You
worked
for
my
father
as
confidential
clerk
and
bookkeeper
for
many
years.
Surely
you
must
remember
his
son,
Nattie
Manning?"

The
mocking
tone
caused
Round
to
frown
darkly.
He
saw
that
further
denial
was
useless.
Curtly
turning
his
back
to
Nattie,
he
stalked
to
a
chair
and
sat
down.
During
this
little
byplay
Ralph
had
been
staring
at
the
intruder
in
a
peculiarly
malevolent
manner.

"What
do
you
want
in
here?"
he
demanded,
at
last.
"This
is
our
private
office,
and
we
receive
people
by
invitation
only.
Get
out."

"With
the
greatest
pleasure,"
sweetly
replied
Nattie.
"I
have
secured
all
that
I
desire.
I
wanted
to
satisfy
myself
as
to
that
man's
identity,
and
I
have
succeeded.
The
removal
of
one's
whiskers
don't
always
form
an
effectual
disguise,
you
know.
Ta!
ta!"

He
left
the
office
with
a
triumphant
smile,
and
quickly
made
his
way
to
the
counting-room
of
the
new
firm.
Grant
and
Mori
were
engrossed
in
drawing
up
several
tables
of
import
orders,
but
they
gave
instant
attention
to
his
story.

"It
certainly
proves
one
thing,"
remarked
the
lame
youth.
"Mr.
Willis
Round
attempted
to
visit
Yokohama
in
disguise.
Now
what
can
be
his
reason?"

Before
either
Nattie
or
Mori
could
reply,
the
front
door
was
thrown
open,
and
the
very
man
they
were
discussing
stepped
into
the
office.
There
was
an
expression
of
cordial
good
nature
upon
his
face,
and
he
advanced
with
one
hand
extended
in
a
friendly
attitude.




CHAPTER
VIII.

ONE
CONSPIRATOR
DEFEATED.


"How
do
you
do,
Master
Grant?
I
am
pleased
to
see
you,"
exclaimed
the
newcomer.
"And
Master
Nattie
here
is
still
the
same
good-looking
lad
as
of
old.
Is
this
the
new
member
of
the
firm?
The
old
company
has
called
in
native
blood,
eh?
Well,
it
is
not
a
bad
idea."

Disregarding
the
cold
stare
of
surprise
given
him
by
Grant,
the
speaker
seated
himself
in
a
comfortable
chair
and
gazed
blandly
around
the
office.
He
was
a
man
of
extreme
attenuation
of
features,
and
restless,
shifting
eyes.
He
was
modestly
clad
in
a
dark
suit
of
English
tweed,
and
carried
the
conventional
cane
of
bamboo.

For
a
moment
there
was
an
awkward
silence,
then
Nattie
laughed--a
short,
curt
laugh,
which
brought
a
perceptible
flush
to
Round's
sunken
cheeks.

"So
you
are
our
old
bookkeeper
after
all?"
said
the
lad,
with
a
sly
wink
at
Mori.

"Yes,
I
am
inclined
to
believe
so,"
replied
the
visitor,
airily.
"I
have
an
explanation
to
make
about
that
little
incident,
my
boy.
D'ye
see,
I
returned
from
London
by
way
of
India
yesterday
morning.
I
had
my
reasons
for
arriving
incog.,
therefore
I
denied
myself
to
you
this
afternoon.
As
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
now,
I'll
tell
you
all
about
it."

He
paused
and
glanced
at
his
auditors.
Nothing
daunted
by
their
evident
coldness,
he
resumed,
in
the
same
light
manner:

"I
had
a
little
deal
on
with
the
government
here
and
certain
people
in
England,
and
I
came
over
to
push
it
through.
Remembering
the
firm
of
Black
&
Company,
I
went
to
them
first.
The
interview
was
not
satisfactory,
however.
Hearing
that
you
had
resumed
your
father's
business.
I
lost
no
time
in
coming
here.
Am
I
right
in
believing
that
you
are
open
for
valuable
contracts?"

Both
Nattie
and
Mori
instinctively
left
the
conversation
to
Grant.
In
a
matter
of
business,
he
was
the
proper
person,
they
well
knew.
The
lame
youth
leaned
back
in
his
chair,
and
eyed
the
visitor
with
extreme
gravity.

"So
you
are
here
to
do
business
with
us,
Mr.
Round?"
he
asked,
slowly.

"Yes."

"May
I
ask
the
nature
of
the
contracts?"

The
ex-bookkeeper
arose
to
his
feet
and
walked
with
catlike
steps
to
the
front
door.
Opening
it
slightly,
he
peered
forth.
Then
he
repeated
the
performance
at
the
remaining
doors
and
windows.
Evidently
satisfied,
he
returned
to
the
desk.
Bending
over,
he
said,
in
a
stage
whisper:

"Government."

"Yes,
I
know,"
exclaimed
Grant,
impatiently.
"You
said
that
before.
But
for
what
class
of
articles?"

"Arms
and
ammunition,
my
boy.
I
have
inside
information.
I
know
that
Japan
will
be
at
war
with
China
before
the
end
of
the
year.
I
also
know
that
the
government
intends
to
place
an
order
for
many
millions
of
cartridges
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
rifles
and
revolvers
within
a
very
short
time."

"Indeed?"

"Yes.
Now,
I
represent
two
firms--one
English
and
one
German,
and
we
wish
to
secure
a
resident
agent
in
Japan.
I
can
recommend
you
to
them,
and
I
will
on
one
condition."

"What
is
it?"
asked
Grant,
drumming
nervously
upon
the
desk.

Nattie
leaned
forward
in
evident
expectancy.
He
knew
that
the
drumming
was
an
ominous
sign
on
his
brother's
part,
and
that
a
climax
was
impending.

"I
wish
to
remain
in
Yokohama,
and
I
desire
a
situation.
If
you
will
give
me
the
same
position
I
formerly
occupied
in
this
office,
I
will
secure
you
the
good
will
of
my
firms.
What
do
you
say?"

Grant
selected
a
letter
from
a
pile
on
the
desk
and
glanced
over
it.
He
smiled
as
if
particularly
well
pleased
at
something,
and
then
asked
in
a
suave
voice:

"When
did
you
leave
London,
Mr.
Round?"

"Why--er--on
the
second
of
last
month."

"And
when
did
you
reach
that
city
after
leaving
my
father's
service?"

"What
the
deuce?--I
mean,
about
two
months
later.
Why
do
you
ask
these
questions?"

"Then
you
have
been
away
from
Japan
for
some
time?"

"Of
course.
I
could
not
be
in
London
and
in
this
country
very
well,"
replied
Round,
with
a
sickly
smile.

"It
is
certainly
strange,"
remarked
Grant,
reading
the
letter
again.
"Have
you
a
twin
brother,
sir?"

At
this
apparently
preposterous
query,
the
visitor
lost
his
affability.

"No,
I
haven't,"
he
almost
shouted.
"Mr.
Manning,
I
did
not
come
here
to
lose
valuable
time
in
answering
silly
questions.
I
have
made
you
a
proposition
in
good
faith.
Will
you
please
give
me
a
reply?"

"So
you
wish
to
enter
our
employ
as
bookkeeper?"

"Yes."

"And
if
we
engage
you
we
can
become
the
agents
of
your
English
and
German
firms
in
this
matter
of
the
government
contracts?"

"Yes,
yes."

Grant
arose
from
his
chair,
and
leaning
one
hand
upon
the
desk,
he
added,
impressively:

"Will
you
also
promise
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
the
Black
debt,
Mr.
Round?"

Nattie
and
Mori,
who
were
keenly
watching
the
visitor's
face,
saw
him
pale
to
the
very
lips.
He
essayed
to
speak,
but
the
words
refused
to
come.
Finally
regaining
his
composure
by
a
violent
effort,
he
replied,
huskily:

"I
don't
understand
you,
Grant.
What
mystery
do
you
mean?"

"You
know
very
well,
sir."

The
lame
youth's
voice
was
sharp
and
cutting.
Nervously
wiping
his
face,
Mr.
Round
glanced
down
at
the
floor,
then
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
his
companions.
If
ever
guilt
rested
in
a
man's
actions,
it
did
then
with
those
of
the
ex-bookkeeper.
He
probably
recognized
the
futility
of
his
chances,
as
he
started
to
leave
without
further
words.
He
was
not
to
escape
so
easily,
however.

"You
have
not
heard
my
answer
to
your
proposition,"
called
out
Grant,
with
sarcasm.
"I'll
tell
you
now
that
we
would
not
have
you
in
this
office
if
you
paid
us
a
bonus
of
a
thousand
pounds.
You
had
better
return
to
your
confederates,
Black
&
Company,
and
inform
them
that
their
effort
to
place
a
spy
in
this
office
has
failed."

"You
will
regret
these
words,"
retorted
Round,
with
a
muttered
oath.
"I'll
show
you
that
you
are
not
so
smart
as
you
think."

"Have
a
care,
sir,"
replied
the
lame
youth.
"Perhaps
we
will
be
able
to
prove
your
connection
with
that
debt
swindle,
and
send
you
up
for
it."

"Bah!
You
are
a
fool
to----"

He
did
not
finish
the
sentence.
At
that
juncture,
Nattie,
who
had
been
quietly
edging
his
way
across
the
office,
bounded
forward.
There
was
a
brief
struggle,
a
crash
at
the
door,
and
suddenly
the
visitor
found
himself
in
the
street,
considerably
the
worse
for
the
encounter.

"That's
the
proper
way
to
get
rid
of
such
callers,"
remarked
the
lad,
cheerfully.
"Talk
is
all
right
in
its
place,
but
actions
are
necessary
at
times.
What
a
scoundrel
he
is!"

"He
is
a
discovered
villain,"
said
Mori,
quaintly.
"In
the
expressive
language
of
the
American
street
gamin,
'We
are
on
to
him.'
He
was
evidently
sent
here
by
the
Blacks
as
a
spy.
By
the
way,
what
was
in
that
letter?"

Grant
laughed,
and
tossed
the
document
to
the
young
Japanese.

"It
was
simply
a
bluff.
I
had
an
idea
the
man
had
not
left
the
country,
so
I
pretended
to
read
a
letter
giving
that
information.
He
bit
beautifully."

"One
thing
is
certain,"
remarked
Mori,
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders.
"We
have
made
an
implacable
enemy."

"What's
the
difference?"
chimed
in
Nattie.
"The
more
the
merrier.
We
need
not
fear
anything
from
Willis
Round.
He's
a
dead
duck
now."

"So
Black
&
Company
have
wind
of
the
impending
contracts,
eh?"
mused
Grant.
"I
must
run
up
and
see
Secretary
Udono
at
once.
I
think
I
can
prove
to
him
that
we
are
worthy
of
the
contracts.
Nattie,
take
this
advertisement
and
have
it
inserted
in
all
the
foreign
and
native
papers.
Tell
them
to
place
it
on
the
first
page
in
display
type.
We'll
let
the
world
know
that
we
are
ready
for
business."

"I'll
call
on
several
old
friends
of
my
father
in
the
morning
and
bid
for
the
next
tea
and
rice
crop,"
said
Mori,
jotting
down
the
items
in
his
notebook.
"How
much
can
we
use
this
quarter?"

"All
we
can
secure,"
was
the
prompt
reply.
"I
intend
to
cable
our
American
houses
at
once.
The
New
York
and
San
Francisco
firms
are
good
for
two
shiploads
at
the
very
least.
By
the
way,
Nattie,
while
you
are
out
just
drop
in
on
Saigo
Brothers
and
see
what
they
have
on
hand
in
lacquered
novelties.
Speak
for
a
good
order
to
go
on
the
steamer
of
the
tenth."

During
the
next
two
hours
the
three
members
of
the
new
firm
were
head
and
ears
in
business.
Grant
was
in
his
element,
and
Mori
seemed
to
like
the
routine
also.
But
Nattie
presently
yawned,
and
left
on
his
errands.
Outdoor
life
was
evidently
more
to
his
taste.

In
the
press
of
work
the
incidents
connected
with
the
visit
of
Willis
Round
were
forgotten.
Grant
and
Mori
labored
at
the
office
until
almost
midnight.
After
attending
to
the
advertisements
Nattie
inspected
the
company's
"go
down,"
or
warehouse,
and
made
preparations
for
the
receiving
of
tea.

The
following
day
was
spent
in
the
same
manner,
and
on
the
second
morning
the
purchases
of
the
firm
began
to
arrive.
By
noon
Manning
Brothers
&
Okuma
were
the
talk
of
Yokohama.
Grant's
popularity
and
business
reputation
secured
him
a
warm
welcome
in
the
trade.

A
force
of
native
clerks
was
installed
in
the
office
under
charge
of
an
expert
foreign
bookkeeper.
It
was
finally
decided
to
assign
the
drumming
up
of
trade
to
Grant,
and
the
interior
buying
and
selling
to
Mori.
Nattie
was
to
have
charge
of
the
shipping
and
the
care
of
the
warehouse.

The
latter
found
time,
however,
to
practice
for
the
coming
wrestling
match
on
the
seventh
of
July.
He
had
secured
the
services
of
a
retired
wrestler,
and
was
soon
in
great
form.
As
can
be
expected,
he
awaited
the
eventful
day
with
growing
impatience.




CHAPTER
IX.

DISASTER
THREATENS.


Grant
Manning
was
a
youth
wise
beyond
his
years.
His
continued
ill
health
and
his
physical
frailty
kept
him
from
mixing
with
the
lads
of
his
age.
The
seclusion
drove
him
to
self-communion
and
study.
As
a
general
rule,
persons
suffering
from
physical
deformity
or
lingering
sickness
are
compensated
by
an
expansion
of
mind.

It
is
the
proof
of
an
immutable
law.
The
blinding
of
one
eye
increases
the
strength
of
the
other.
The
deaf
and
dumb
are
gifted
with
a
wonderful
sense
of
touch.
Those
with
crippled
legs
are
strong
of
arm.
The
unfortunates
with
brains
awry
are
endowed
with
muscles
of
power.

In
Grant's
case
his
intellect
made
amends
for
his
deformity
of
body.
He
loved
commercial
work,
and
the
several
years
passed
in
the
counting-room
under
his
father's
_régime_
had
made
him
a
thorough
master
of
the
business.

When
orders
commenced
to
find
their
way
to
the
new
firm
he
was
in
his
element.
As
I
have
stated
before,
he
had
many
friends
in
Yokohama
and
the
capital,
Tokio,
and
the
native
merchants
made
haste
to
open
trade
with
him.
To
aid
this
prosperity,
was
the
fact
that
no
stain
rested
upon
the
firm
of
John
Manning
&
Company.

The
very
name
was
synonymous
with
honesty,
integrity
and
merit.
Foreign
houses
established
in
Eastern
countries
too
often
treat
their
customers
as
uncivilized
beings
destined
to
be
tricked
in
trade.
John
Manning
had
never
entertained
such
an
unwise
policy,
and
his
sons
now
felt
the
results.

The
announcements
in
the
various
papers
brought
an
avalanche
of
contracts
and
orders.
On
the
fourth
day
after
the
birth
of
the
new
firm,
Mori--who
was
really
a
shrewd,
far-seeing
youth--had
secured
the
cream
of
the
tea
and
rice
crop.
He
was
also
promised
the
first
bid
for
silks.

On
his
part,
Grant
had
secured
a
satisfactory
interview
with
the
secretary
of
war
in
regard
to
the
army
contracts
for
arms
and
ammunition.
Business
was
literally
booming,
and
every
foreign
importing
firm
in
Yokohama
felt
the
new
competition.

It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
they
would
permit
the
trade
to
slip
away
without
an
effort
to
retain
it.
Not
the
least
of
those
disturbed
was
the
firm
of
Black
&
Company,
as
can
well
be
imagined.
The
merchant
and
Ralph
were
wild
with
rage
and
despair.
Orders
from
various
English
houses
were
on
file
for
early
tea
and
rice,
but
the
market
was
empty.
Mori
had
been
the
early
bird.

"If
this
continues
we
will
have
to
close
our
doors,"
exclaimed
Mr.
Black,
gloomily.
"I
could
not
buy
a
dozen
boxes
of
tea
this
morning,
and
we
have
an
order
of
three
hundred
to
leave
by
to-morrow's
steamer.
The
fiend
take
that
crippled
whelp!
He
is
here,
there,
and
everywhere,
and
the
natives
in
town
are
begging
for
his
trade."

"He
will
make
a
pretty
penny
raising
the
prices
too,"
replied
his
son,
in
the
same
tone.
"Why,
he
and
that
Japanese
fool
have
made
a
regular
corner
in
rice."

"But
he
is
not
going
to
increase
the
price,
if
rumor
speaks
the
truth.
Although
he
has
control
of
the
crop,
he
ships
it
to
America
at
the
old
rates."

"That
is
a
shrewd
move,"
acknowledged
Ralph,
reluctantly.
"It
will
make
him
solid
with
every
firm
in
the
United
States.
What
is
the
matter
with
all
of
the
old
merchants,
eh?
Fancy
a
man
like
you
letting
a
boy
get
the
best
of
him
in
this
manner.
If
I
was
the
head
of
an
established
house
and
had
gray
hairs
like
you
I'd
quit
the
business."

This
brutal
speech
caused
the
merchant
to
flush
angrily.
He
was
on
the
point
of
retorting,
but
he
checked
himself
and
remained
buried
in
thought
for
some
time.
His
reflections
were
bitter.
It
was
humiliating
to
think
that
a
firm
of
boys
should
step
in
and
steal
the
trade
from
men
who
had
spent
years
in
the
business.

The
brow
of
the
merchant
grew
dark.
He
would
not
stand
it.
If
fair
means
could
not
avail,
he
would
resort
to
foul.
His
conscience,
long
deadened
by
trickery,
formed
no
bar
to
his
resolution.
Striking
the
desk
with
his
open
hand,
he
exclaimed:

"I
will
do
it
no
matter
what
comes."

"What's
up
now,
dad?"
asked
Ralph,
with
a
show
of
interest.
He
added,
sneeringly:
"Are
you
awakening
from
your
'Rip
Van
Winkle'
sleep?
Do
you
think
it
is
time
to
get
up
and
circumvent
those
fools?
Name
your
plan,
and
I
will
give
you
my
help
with
the
greatest
pleasure."

"You
can
assist
me.
We
must
destroy
the
credit
of
the
new
firm.
They
have
a
working
capital
of
only
twelve
or
thirteen
thousand
dollars.
I
learned
this
morning
that
they
had
given
notes
for
ninety
days
for
twice
that
amount
of
money.
It
is
also
said
that
the
firm
of
Takatsuna
&
Company
has
sold
them
ten
thousand
dollars'
worth
of
tea
at
sight.
Grant
arranged
for
an
overdraw
with
a
native
bank
inside
of
an
hour.
Now
if
we
can
get
up
a
scare,
Takatsuna
will
come
down
on
the
bank
for
his
money,
and
the
bank
will
call
on
the
Mannings
for
it."

"That
is
a
great
scheme,"
said
Ralph,
admiringly.
"We
will
try
it
at
once."

"Go
to
Round's
hotel
and
bring
him
here.
In
the
meantime
I
will
finish
the
details,
my
son.
If
all
goes
well,
that
cripple
and
his
brother
will
be
paupers
before
night."

"And
we
will
be
able
to
fill
our
orders
by
to-morrow
at
the
latest.
If
Manning
Brothers
&
Okuma
fail,
the
dealers
will
gladly
come
to
us."

"I
do
not
care
a
snap
of
a
finger
for
the
tea
business,"
replied
Mr.
Black,
contemptuously.
"It
is
that
army
contract
I
am
after.
I
have
been
told
that
Grant
has
had
an
interview
with
the
secretary.
Now,
if
we
don't
kill
the
firm
they
will
have
the
plum
as
sure
as
death.
Bring
Round
here
without
delay."

Ralph
laughed
as
he
walked
to
the
door.

"Willis
has
been
in
the
sulks
since
he
failed
to
carry
out
our
little
scheme
of
placing
him
in
the
Manning
counting-room
as
a
spy.
He
hates
them
worse
than
ever.
He
will
prove
a
valuable
ally
in
the
present
plan."

In
the
course
of
an
hour
he
returned
with
the
ex-bookkeeper.
Before
noon
strange
rumors
commenced
to
circulate
among
the
foreign
merchants
and
the
banks.
By
one
o'clock
the
native
houses
were
agog
with
the
news.
Men
met
on
the
Bund
and
talked
over
the
startling
intelligence.
At
two
a
representative
from
the
firm
of
Takatsuna
called
at
the
office
of
Manning
Brothers
&
Okuma.

"I
am
very
sorry,"
he
said,
"but
my
firm
is
in
pressing
need
of
money.
It
is
short
notice,
I
acknowledge,
but
we
must
have
the
ten
thousand
dollars
you
owe
us
for
tea
at
once."

Grant
looked
surprised,
but
he
politely
sent
the
representative
to
the
Yokohama
bank
where
the
check
had
been
negotiated.
In
half
an
hour
an
urgent
call
came
from
the
bank
for
the
senior
member
of
the
firm.
When
Grant
returned
to
the
office
his
face
wore
an
anxious
expression.

"Boys,
our
enemies
are
at
work,"
he
said.
"It
is
said
on
'Change
that
we
are
pinched
for
funds.
Black
&
Company
are
urging
the
native
merchants
to
ask
for
their
bills.
The
bank
paid
Takatsuna
their
money,
but
the
directors
want
it
refunded
at
once."

He
had
hardly
ceased
speaking
before
a
knock
sounded
at
the
door
of
the
private
office.
Nattie
opened
it,
giving
admission
to
a
portly
Japanese.
The
newcomer's
dress
was
disordered,
and
he
appeared
wild
with
anxiety.
It
was
the
president
of
the
Yokohama
bank.

At
his
heels
were
several
merchants
and
half
a
dozen
reporters.
Ill
news
travels
fast.
Regardless
of
ceremony,
the
visitors
crowded
into
the
office.
Grant's
face
became
set,
and
his
eyes
glittered.
Nattie
appeared
highly
amused.
He
saw
the
comical
side
of
the
invasion,
not
the
serious.

It
was
really
a
critical
moment.
In
commercial
circles
there
is
nothing
more
disastrous
and
credit-snapping
than
a
run
on
a
bank,
or
the
failure
to
promptly
pay
a
bill.
The
standing
of
a
new
firm
is
always
uncertain.
Like
gold,
it
requires
time
and
a
trial
in
the
fire
of
experience.

Grant
realized
the
danger
at
once.
As
the
newcomers
surged
into
the
office,
he
arose
from
the
desk
and
grasped
the
back
of
his
chair
with
a
clutch
of
despair.
His
thoughts
traveled
fast.
He
saw
the
ruin
of
his
hopes,
the
success
of
his
enemies;
and
he
almost
groaned
aloud.

Outwardly
he
was
calm,
however.
Politely
greeting
the
president
of
the
bank,
he
asked
the
nature
of
his
business.
With
feverish
hands,
the
man
produced
a
paper,
and
requested
the
payment
of
the
ten
thousand
dollars.

"Remember,
my
dear
sir,
I
am
first
on
the
spot,"
he
said.

The
words
were
significant.
It
meant
a
call
for
money
from
all
creditors.
It
meant
the
swamping
of
their
credit
and
absolute
failure.
Preserving
his
calmness,
Grant
picked
up
the
firm's
check-book,
and
glanced
over
the
stubs.

Of
the
twenty
thousand
dollars
paid
in
by
Mori,
but
a
trifle
over
one-half
remained.
There
were
other
creditors
at
the
door.
To
pay
one
meant
a
demand
from
the
others.
To
refuse
the
payment
of
the
bank's
debt
was
to
be
posted
as
insolvent.
That
meant
ruin.

Sick
at
heart,
Grant
was
on
the
point
of
adopting
the
latter
course,
when
there
came
a
sudden
and
most
unexpected
change
in
the
state
of
affairs.




CHAPTER
X.

MORI
SHOWS
HIS
GENEROSITY.


During
the
scene
in
the
private
office
of
the
firm
Mori
had
remained
silent
and
apparently
indifferent.
Apparently
only--those
who
knew
him
best
would
have
augured
from
the
appearance
of
the
two
bright
red
spots
in
his
dark
cheeks
that
he
was
intensely
interested.

He
watched
the
movements
of
the
crowd
at
the
door,
he
listened
to
the
demand
of
the
bank
president,
and
he
noted
Grant's
struggle
to
appear
calm.
Then
just
as
the
lame
youth
turned
from
the
check-book
to
his
auditors
with
an
announcement
of
their
failure
to
pay
trembling
upon
his
lips,
the
young
Japanese
introduced
himself
into
the
proceedings.

"What
is
the
meaning
of
this,
sir?"
he
asked
the
president,
sharply.
"What
do
you
wish?"

"I
am
here
for
my
money,"
was
the
defiant
reply.
"I
have
presented
the
note,
and
I
await
payment."

"Don't
you
think
this
is
rather
sudden?"
asked
Mori,
with
a
suspicious
calmness
in
his
voice.
"It
was
negotiated
but
yesterday.
Why
this
haste?"

"I
want
my
money,"
was
the
only
answer
vouchsafed.

"And
you
at
the
door,"
continued
the
Japanese
youth,
turning
his
gaze
in
that
direction.
"Are
you
here
for
the
same
reason?"

Some
one
in
the
rear
rank
replied
in
the
affirmative.

Mori's
eyes
flashed.
Taking
a
private
check-book
from
his
pocket,
he
rapidly
wrote
several
lines
therein,
and,
detaching
a
leaf,
tossed
it
to
Grant.

"Pay
them,
every
one,"
he
said,
carelessly.
"You
will
find
that
sufficient,
I
think."

The
lame
youth
eagerly
read
the
check,
and
then
his
face
became
suffused
with
emotion.
The
amount
called
for
was
thirty
thousand
dollars!
Mori
had
placed
his
whole
fortune
to
the
firm's
account!
Afraid
to
trust
his
voice,
Grant
hobbled
over
to
the
youthful
native,
and,
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
assemblage,
threw
his
arms
around
him.

"God
bless
you!"
he
exclaimed.
"You
are
a
friend
and
a
man."

"Nonsense,"
replied
Mori,
gently.
"It
is
nothing.
Pay
these
cattle
off,
and
put
them
down
in
your
black
book.
Pay
them
in
full
and
rid
the
office
of
the
mob
for
good.
And,
understand,"
he
added,
addressing
the
bank
president
and
his
companions,
"we
will
have
no
further
dealings
with
you.
Hereafter
we
will
trade
with
men
not
liable
to
scare
at
the
slightest
rumor."

The
official
took
the
check
extended
him
by
Grant
with
a
crestfallen
air.
He
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
had
lost
the
business
of
the
new
firm.
Too
late
he
recalled
the
fact
that
he
had
really
heard
nothing
of
moment.
Rumors
had
been
circulated,
but
try
as
he
would,
he
could
not
recollect
their
source.

The
remaining
creditors
also
suffered
a
revulsion
of
feeling.
Some
attempted
to
slink
away,
but
the
three
members
of
the
firm
singled
them
out
one
by
one,
and
compelled
them
to
accept
checks
for
the
amount
of
their
bills.

In
an
hour
eighteen
thousand
dollars
had
been
paid
out,
but
the
credit
of
the
firm
was
saved.
When
the
last
man
had
been
sent
away
Nattie
and
Grant
overwhelmed
the
clever
young
Japanese
with
congratulations
and
heartfelt
thanks.
Mori's
modesty
equaled
his
generosity,
and
he
threatened
them
with
immediate
dissolution
if
they
did
not
refrain.

"It
is
nothing,
my
friends,"
he
exclaimed,
for
the
hundredth
time.
"I
am
only
glad
that
I
was
able
to
furnish
the
money."

"You
must
withdraw
the
entire
amount
just
as
soon
as
it
is
available,"
insisted
Grant.
"We
should
hear
from
the
American
houses
within
five
weeks,
and
then
we
will
return
to
the
old
basis."

"I
would
like
to
have
a
photograph
of
old
Black's
face
when
he
hears
the
news,"
said
Nattie,
with
a
grin.
"Or,
better
still,
overhear
his
comments."

"It
was
a
shrewd
trick,
but
it
failed,
I
am
glad
to
say,"
remarked
the
lame
youth.
"We
must
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
and
clinch
the
effect.
Now
is
the
time
to
set
our
credit
upon
a
solid
foundation."

Taking
several
sheets
of
paper,
he
scribbled
half
a
dozen
lines
upon
them.

"Nattie,
take
these
to
the
different
newspaper
offices,
and
have
them
inserted
in
to-morrow's
issues,"
he
said.
"Then
drop
in
at
the
printing
office
and
tell
Bates
to
work
up
a
thousand
posters
to
be
displayed
about
town.
How
does
this
sound?







"'TO
WHOM
IT
MAY
CONCERN:






"'A

"'MANNING
BROTHERS
&
OKUMA'"


"That
is
just
the
thing!"
exclaimed
Mori.
"It
could
not
be
better.
We'll
have
the
posters
distributed
broadcast
over
Yokohama
and
also
Tokio.
Make
it
five
instead
of
one
thousand,
Grant.
Really,
I
believe
that
little
affair
will
do
us
a
great
deal
of
good.
It
is
an
excellent
advertisement."

Nattie
hurried
away
to
the
printing
office,
and
by
night
the
two
cities
were
reading
the
posters.
At
ten
o'clock
the
following
morning
fully
two
score
merchants
had
called
upon
the
firm,
but
they
came
to
ask
for
trade,
not
to
present
bills.

The
conspiracy
had
resolved
itself
into
a
boomerang,
and
the
firm
of
Manning
Brothers
&
Okuma
was
more
prosperous
than
ever.
Black
&
Son
were
correspondingly
depressed.
The
failure
of
their
latest
scheme
caused
the
elder
merchant
much
humiliation.
At
a
meeting
held
in
his
office,
attended
by
Ralph
and
Mr.
Round,
it
was
resolved
to
stick
at
nothing
to
defeat
the
enemy.

"It
is
war
to
the
knife
now,"
exclaimed
the
head
of
the
firm,
grinding
his
teeth.
"Something
must
be
done
before
the
first
of
next
month,
as
the
army
contracts
will
be
awarded
then."

"And
that
means
a
little
trifle
of
twenty
thousand
pounds,
eh?"
replied
the
ex-bookkeeper,
softly
rubbing
his
hands.

"Yes,
one
hundred
thousand
dollars.
That
is
clear
profit."

"Many
a
man
would
commit
murder
for
less
than
that,"
mused
Ralph,
absently
stabbing
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
a
penknife.

Mr.
Black
gave
his
son
a
keen
glance.

"Yes,"
he
said,
in
a
peculiar
tone.
"Whole
families
have
been
put
out
of
the
way
for
as
many
cents.
But,"
he
added,
hastily,
"there
is
no
such
question
in
our
case.
Ha!
ha!
the
idea
is
simply
preposterous!"

His
companions
echoed
the
laugh,
but
in
a
strained
fashion.
Ralph
continued
to
stare
moodily
at
the
floor.
After
a
while
Willis
Round
announced
that
he
had
a
proposition
to
make.

"You
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
it
was
war
to
the
knife
now,"
he
commenced.

"Yes."

"It
is
to
your
interest
to
ruin
the
new
firm
before
the
awarding
of
the
army
contracts,
eh?"

"Certainly.
If
they
are
in
business
by
the
end
of
the
present
month
they
will
secure
the
valuable
contracts
without
a
doubt."

"What
would
you
give
if
they
were
rendered
unable
to
bid
for
them?"

The
merchant
stared
at
his
questioner
half
contemptuously.

"Why
do
you
ask?
You
do
not
think
you
could
ruin
them
single-handed?"
he
asked,
banteringly.

"Never
you
mind,"
was
the
dogged
reply.
"Answer
my
question.
What
would
you
give
if
the
contracts
were
placed
in
your
way?"

"Twenty
per
cent.
of
the
profits
and
our
assistance
in
any
scheme
you
may
propose.
Do
you
really
mean
to
say
that
you
have
a
plan
promising
success?"

The
merchant
left
his
chair
in
his
eagerness
and
approached
the
ex-bookkeeper.
Ralph
showed
a
renewed
interest
also.
Before
replying,
Round
cautiously
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
counting-room.
After
satisfying
himself,
he
talked
long
and
earnestly
to
his
companions.
At
the
conclusion
the
faces
of
the
merchant
and
his
son
were
expressive
of
the
liveliest
satisfaction.
There
was
trouble
still
in
store
for
the
new
firm
of
Manning
Brothers
&
Okuma.




CHAPTER
XI.

NATTIE
MAKES
A
DISCOVERY.


During
the
important
and
engrossing
events
of
the
past
few
days
Nattie
had
not
forgotten
the
sport
promised
for
the
seventh
of
the
month.
He
was
passionately
fond
of
athletics,
and
he
never
let
slip
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
all
that
came
his
way.

Extensive
preparations
had
been
made
for
the
celebration
of
the
treaty
made
by
Commodore
Perry
in
the
year
1853.
Not
only
the
foreign
residents
were
to
take
part,
but
the
natives
themselves
promised
a
great
_matsura_,
or
festival.

The
committee
of
the
Yokohama
Club,
under
whose
auspices
it
was
to
take
place,
had
secured
the
racing
grounds
upon
the
bluff.
A
varied
programme
had
been
arranged
to
cover
the
entire
day.
The
sports
had
been
divided
into
two
parts,
modern
racing
and
games
in
the
forenoon,
and
ancient
native
ceremonies
after
tiffin.

The
main
feature
of
the
latter
was
to
be
a
grand
wrestling
match
between
foreigners.
To
add
to
the
interest,
the
competitors
were
to
remain
unknown
to
each
other
until
the
moment
of
their
appearance
in
the
ring.

Nattie
had
given
in
his
name
among
the
first.
The
prize
offered
was
a
valuable
medal
and
a
crown
of
laurel.
For
several
days
the
lad
had
devoted
his
idle
hours
to
practice
with
a
retired
native
wrestler.
The
evening
before
the
seventh
he
was
in
fine
fettle.

As
an
added
chance,
however,
he
resolved
to
take
one
more
lesson
from
his
instructor--a
final
bout
to
place
him
in
good
trim
for
the
morrow.
The
scene
of
the
practice
matches
was
in
the
large
"go-down,"
or
warehouse,
of
the
firm,
located
near
a
canal
separating
the
bluff
from
the
native
quarter.

The
appointment
for
the
evening
was
at
nine,
and
shortly
before
that
hour
Nattie
left
a
tea
house
on
his
way
to
the
place
of
destination.
The
day
had
been
sultry,
and
toward
nightfall
threatening
clouds
gathered
over
the
bay.

Rain
promised,
but
that
fact
did
not
deter
the
lad.
As
his
_'rikisha_
sped
along
the
Bund
he
recalled
the
points
already
taught
him
by
his
master
in
the
art
of
wrestling,
and
he
fancied
the
ringing
of
cheers
and
the
outburst
of
plaudits
were
already
greeting
him.

The
Manning
"go-down"
was
a
large
square
structure
of
stone,
with
iron
shutters
and
massive
doors.
It
was
considered
fireproof,
and
had
as
a
watchman
a
brawny
Irishman
recently
paid
off
from
a
sailing
ship.
His
name
was
Patrick
Cronin,
and
he
claimed
to
be
an
American
by
naturalization.

On
reaching
the
entrance
Nattie
looked
around
for
the
fellow,
but
he
was
not
in
sight.
Taking
a
key
from
his
pocket,
he
opened
a
narrow
door
leading
into
a
little
corner
office.
As
he
passed
inside
there
came
a
wild
gust
of
wind
and
a
downpour
of
rain.
The
storm
had
burst.

"Good
job
I
arrived
in
time,"
muttered
the
lad.
"Whew!
how
it
does
pour
down.
Looks
as
if
it
has
started
in
for
three
or
four
hours
at
least.
If
it
keeps
on
I
needn't
expect
old
Yokoi.
I
wonder
where
Patrick
is?"

He
whistled
shrilly
and
thumped
upon
the
floor
with
his
cane,
but
only
the
echoes
came
to
his
ears.
After
a
moment
of
thought
he
lighted
a
lantern
and
sat
down
near
a
window
opening
upon
a
narrow
alley
running
between
the
building
and
the
canal.

The
absence
of
the
watchman
was
certainly
strange.
It
was
his
duty
to
report
at
the
"go-down"
at
six
o'clock.
In
fact,
Nattie
had
seen
him
that
very
evening.
The
building
was
full
of
valuable
silks,
teas,
and
lacquered
ware,
intended
for
shipment
on
the
following
day.

Thieves
were
rampant
along
the
canal,
several
daring
robberies
having
occurred
during
the
past
week.
Then
again
there
was
always
the
danger
of
fire.
As
the
lad
sat
in
his
chair
and
thought
over
the
possible
results
of
the
Irishman's
dereliction,
he
grew
thoroughly
indignant.

"By
George!
he'll
not
work
for
us
another
day,"
he
muttered,
giving
the
stick
a
vicious
whirl.
"I'll
wager
a
_yen_
he
is
in
some
groggery
at
this
very
moment
drinking
with
a
chance
shipmate."

Going
to
the
door
he
glanced
out
into
the
night.
The
rain
was
still
descending
in
torrents,
and
it
was
of
that
steadiness
promising
a
continuation.
When
Nattie
returned
to
his
seat
it
was
with
the
resolution
to
keep
guard
over
the
firm's
property
himself.

It
meant
a
long
and
lonely
watch
with
naught
save
the
beating
of
the
rain,
the
dreary
gloom
of
the
interior,
and
the
murmuring
sounds
from
the
nearby
bay
for
company.
The
lad
had
a
stout
heart,
however,
and
he
settled
himself
for
the
vigil
without
more
ado.

He
found
comfort
in
the
anticipation
of
a
scene
with
the
recreant
watchman
in
the
morning.
He
made
up
his
mind
even
to
refuse
him
admission
if
he
returned
to
the
"go
down"
that
night.
The
minutes
dragged
slowly,
and
at
last
the
watcher
found
himself
nodding.

"Jove!
this
won't
do,"
he
exclaimed,
springing
from
his
chair.
"I
am
as
bad
as
Patrick.
The
lantern
is
going
out
also.
Wonder
if
I
have
any
matches
in
my
pocket?"

He
searched,
but
without
favorable
results.
A
hasty
examination
revealed
the
unwelcome
fact
that
the
oil
receptacle
was
empty.
In
another
moment
the
light
flickered
and
died
out,
leaving
the
little
office
in
darkness.

Disturbed
in
spirit,
Nattie
went
to
the
door,
almost
inclined
to
visit
some
neighboring
warehouse
or
shop
for
oil
and
matches.
One
glance
at
the
deluge
still
falling
drove
the
idea
from
his
head.
He
was
without
umbrella
or
rain
coat,
and
to
venture
for
even
a
short
distance
would
mean
a
thorough
drenching--something
to
be
religiously
avoided
in
Japan
during
the
summer
season.

"Heigho!
I
am
in
for
it,
I
suppose.
Confound
that
Irishman!
I
would
like
to
punch
his
empty
noddle
for
this.
Here
I
am
in
the
dark,
condemned
to
remain
all
night
without
sleep,
and--by
jingo!"

A
very
sudden
and
painful
thought
had
occurred
to
the
lad.
The
morrow
was
the
day
upon
which
he
was
to
shine
as
a
wrestler!
The
seventh
of
July;
the
day
of
sports
in
celebration
of
Commodore
Perry's
treaty.

"I'll
be
fit
for
athletics
and
wrestling
matches
if
I
stay
around
here
and
lose
my
sleep!"
murmured
Nattie,
ruefully.
"Why,
I'll
be
all
played
out,
and
a
five-year-old
boy
could
throw
me.
But
what
in
thunder
can
I
do?
I
can't
leave
and
run
the
risk
of
the
place
catching
fire.
There's
more
than
twenty
thousand
dollars'
worth
of
stuff
in
here,
and
it
would
be
just
nuts
to
a
thief
to
find
himself
among
all
those
silks."

It
was
impossible
to
communicate
with
either
Grant
or
Mori.
The
streets
in
the
warehouse
district
were
unfrequented,
and
in
such
a
violent
storm
even
the
policemen
would
hie
themselves
to
a
convenient
shelter.
Muttering
maledictions
upon
the
head
of
the
absent
watchman,
Nattie
closed
the
door
and
returned
to
his
seat
near
the
window.

Occasional
flashes
of
lightning
illuminated
the
outside,
and
during
one
of
these
the
lad
espied
a
man
crossing
the
bridge
at
the
corner
of
the
building.
Thinking
it
might
be
some
kindly
person
who
would
not
disdain
to
carry
a
message,
he
hurried
to
the
door
leading
into
the
street.

As
he
opened
it
he
heard
voices.
The
newcomer
had
paused
and
was
looking
back
at
the
indistinct
figure
of
a
second
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
canal.
In
the
intervals
of
light
Nattie
observed
the
person
nearest
him
start
back
and
evidently
expostulate
with
his
follower.

They
were
barely
ten
yards
away,
and
by
the
aid
of
a
brilliant
flash
of
lightning
the
lad
noticed
something
familiar
in
the
appearance
of
both
men.
One
was
tall
and
thin,
while
the
other
had
a
short,
stumpy
form
and
a
rolling
lurch
as
he
wavered
vaguely
near
the
end
of
the
bridge.

"Get
back,
man.
What
do
you
want
to
come
out
in
this
wet
for
when
you
have
a
cozy
nook
in
yon
house?
Go
back,
I
say."

It
was
the
attenuated
individual
who
had
spoken.
He
placed
one
hand
upon
his
companion's
arm,
but
the
fellow
staggered
away
and
replied:

"Got--hic--my
dooty
ter
do.
Oi'm
too
long
away
as
'tis,
m'
boy.
Dash
ther--hic--rain.
It
ain't
wetter
in
th'
blooming
ocean,
knife
me
if
'tis."

"You
are
a
fool
to
come
out
in
it,
I
say.
Return
to
the
house,
and
I'll
join
you
presently.
There
are
three
more
bottles
of
prime
stuff
in
the
closet.
Break
one
out
and
help
yourself."

"But
me
dooty,
man!
It
has
never
been
said
that--hic--Pat
Cronin
ever
went
back
on
a
job.
Ask
me
shipmates.
Why,
they
sing
er
song
about
me:







"'So
he
seized
th'
capstan
bar,





Like
a
true
honest
tar,





And
in
spite
or
tears
and
sighs





Sung
yo!
heave
ho!'"


"Shut
up;
you
will
have
the
police
after
us,"
expostulated
the
other.
"Do
you
intend
to
return
to
the
house,
or
shall
I
lock
up
the
bottles?
Answer
me,
yes
or
no?"

"Sure
and
Oi
don't
want
to
lose
th'
drink,
but----"

"Yes,
or
no?"

"Ah,
it's
th'
funny
man
ye
are.
He!
he!
he!
Phwy
don't
yer
git
fat?
If
Oi----"

"Then
it
is
'no,'
eh?
Well,
here----"

"Hould
an,
me
buck.
Oi'll
go
back
and
take
another
swig.
Then
to
me
dooty,
yer
understand.
Here
goes.







"'So
he
seized
th'
(hic)
capstan
bar,





Like
a
true
honest
tar,





And
in
spite
of----'"


The
husky
notes
died
away,
a
door
slammed
in
one
of
a
row
of
wooden
shanties
across
the
bridge,
and
all
was
quiet.
The
tall,
thin
man
glanced
keenly
after
his
companion;
then,
slipping
up
to
the
Manning
"go-down,"
he
examined
the
entrance.
It
was
locked.
Inserting
a
key
he
soon
gained
admission.
As
he
softly
closed
the
door
again
he
stood
within
a
pace
of
Nattie.

It
had
not
taken
the
lad
many
seconds
to
catch
the
drift
of
affairs.
He
knew
full
well
that
Patrick's
tempter
was
no
other
than
Willis
Round,
the
firm's
ex-bookkeeper.
His
presence
in
that
locality
during
a
heavy
storm,
his
familiarity
with
the
recreant
watchman,
the
evident
and
successful
attempt
to
entice
him
away
from
his
post,
could
have
only
one
meaning.

He
had
designs
on
the
property
of
his
enemies.

Long
before
Patrick
had
lurched
back
to
the
shanty
Nattie
had
slipped
into
the
office.
When
he
heard
the
key
grating
in
the
lock
he
was
not
surprised;
but
he
was
considerably
puzzled
as
to
the
best
manner
in
which
he
should
treat
the
situation.

"If
I
only
had
my
revolver
I
would
bring
the
scoundrel
to
terms,"
he
muttered,
regretfully.
"I
had
to
leave
it
home
this
night
of
all
nights.
As
it
is,
I
haven't
a
solitary
weapon.
A
bamboo
cane
wouldn't
hurt
a
fly.
Ah,
I'll
try
the
lantern."

Creeping
across
the
floor
he
secured
the
object
just
as
the
ex-bookkeeper
reached
the
door.
Returning
to
his
post,
the
lad
waited
with
rapidly
beating
heart.




CHAPTER
XII.

THE
STRUGGLE
IN
THE
"GO-DOWN."


That
Willis
Round
meant
injury
was
plainly
evident.
But
whether
he
came
as
a
thief
or
incendiary
was
yet
to
be
ascertained.
He
knew
the
ground
well,
so
he
lost
little
time
in
entering.
After
closing
the
door
he
hesitated.

At
his
elbow
stood
the
brave
lad
with
lantern
raised
in
readiness.
At
the
first
sign
of
a
light,
or
the
scratch
of
a
match,
he
meant
to
strike
with
all
the
power
of
his
arm.
The
lantern
was
a
heavy
iron
affair,
and
Willis
Round
was
as
near
death
at
that
moment
as
he
probably
had
been
during
his
eventful
career.

His
knowledge
of
the
"go-down's"
interior
saved
him.
After
a
brief
pause
he
started
toward
the
main
portion
of
the
warehouse.
At
his
heels
crept
Nattie,
silent,
determined,
resolute.

The
main
room
of
the
warehouse
was
crowded
with
bales
of
silk,
chests
of
tea,
and
various
boxes
containing
lacquered
ware.
These
had
been
arranged
in
an
orderly
manner
with
passageways
extending
between
the
different
piles.

In
one
thing
the
lad
had
an
advantage;
he
was
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
arrangement
of
the
goods,
while
Round
had
only
a
general
knowledge
of
the
interior.
The
latter
stumbled
several
times,
but
he
made
no
move
to
show
a
light.

Presently
Nattie
felt
his
curiosity
aroused.
What
could
be
the
man's
object?
Was
it
theft
of
valuable
silks
or
deliberate
incendiarism?
That
the
fellow
had
a
certain
destination
in
view
was
made
evident
by
his
actions.

During
the
day
the
place
was
lighted
by
large
glazed
windows
at
the
ends
and
on
each
side,
but
at
night
these
were
closed
with
iron
shutters.
In
the
roof
were
several
long
skylights,
and
through
them
an
occasional
glare
came
from
the
lightning,
which
still
fitfully
shot
athwart
the
sky.

It
was
by
the
aid
of
one
of
these
that
the
lad
finally
saw
the
intruder
halt
near
a
pile
of
tea
chests.
The
flash
lasted
only
an
instant,
but
it
brought
out
in
clear
relief
the
attenuated
figure
of
the
scoundrel.
He
was
standing
within
reach
of
a
number
of
boxes
packed
ready
for
shipment
on
the
morrow.

They
were
wrapped
in
straw
matting,
and
nearby
was
a
little
heap
of
the
same
material
to
be
used
on
other
chests.
It
was
highly
inflammable.
This
fact
recurred
to
the
lad
with
startling
significance,
and
he
involuntarily
hurried
forward.

Before
he
could
realize
his
mistake
he
was
within
a
step
of
Round.
A
slight
cough
from
the
latter
caused
Nattie
to
abruptly
check
himself.
With
a
gasp
of
excitement
he
shrank
back,
and
slipped
behind
a
large
bale
of
silks.

The
next
moment
a
blinding
flash
of
lightning
revealed
the
interior
of
the
warehouse.
Before
it
died
away
the
plucky
lad
peered
forth,
but
only
to
find
that
a
change
had
taken
place
in
affairs.
The
ex-bookkeeper
was
not
in
sight.

It
was
an
unwelcome
discovery,
to
say
the
least.
With
the
enemy
in
view,
it
was
easy
to
keep
track
of
his
intentions.
Now
he
might
be
retreating
to
any
part
of
the
vast
"go-down"
where
in
temporary
security
he
could
start
a
conflagration
at
his
leisure.

"I
must
find
him
at
all
hazards,"
muttered
Nattie,
somewhat
discomfited.
"Why
didn't
I
bring
matters
to
a
point
in
the
office?
or
why
didn't
I
strike
him
down
while
I
had
the
chance
a
moment
ago?
I'll
not
fool
any
more."

Grasping
the
iron
lantern
in
readiness
for
instant
use,
he
slipped
forward
step
by
step.
At
every
yard
he
paused
and
listened
intently.
The
silence
was
both
oppressive
and
ominous.
He
would
have
given
a
great
deal
if
even
a
rustle
or
a
sigh
had
reached
his
ears.

As
time
passed
without
incident
the
lad
grew
bolder.
His
anxiety
spurred
him
on.
He
hastened
his
movements
and
peered
from
side
to
side
in
vain
endeavor
to
pierce
the
gloom.
Where
had
the
man
gone?
Probably
he
was
even
then
preparing
to
strike
the
match
that
would
ignite
the
building.

Unable
to
endure
longer
the
suspense,
Nattie
swung
into
a
side
aisle
and
ran
plump
into
some
yielding
object.
There
was
a
muttered
cry
of
surprise
and
terror;
then,
in
the
space
of
a
second,
the
interior
resounded
with
shouts
and
blows
and
the
hubbub
of
a
struggle.

At
the
very
start
Nattie
lost
his
only
weapon.
In
the
sudden
and
unexpected
collision
the
lantern
was
dashed
from
his
hand.
Before
he
could
recover
it
he
felt
two
sinewy
arms
thrown
about
his
middle,
then
with
a
tug
he
was
forced
against
a
bale.

It
required
only
a
moment
for
the
athletic
lad
to
free
himself.
Long
training
at
sports
and
games
came
to
his
aid.
Wriggling
toward
the
floor,
he
braced
himself
and
gave
a
mighty
upward
heave.
At
the
same
time,
finding
his
arms
released,
he
launched
out
with
both
clinched
fists.

There
was
a
thud,
a
stifled
cry,
and
then
a
pile
of
tea
chests
close
at
hand
fell
downward
with
a
loud
crash.
Quick
to
realize
his
opportunity,
Nattie
slipped
away
and
placed
a
large
box
between
his
antagonist
and
himself.

The
scrimmage
had
only
served
to
increase
his
anxiety
and
anger.
When
he
regained
his
breath
he
called
out,
hotly:

"You
confounded
scoundrel,
I'll
capture
you
yet.
I
know
you,
Willis
Round,
and
if
this
night's
work
don't
place
you
in
prison
it'll
not
be
my
fault."

The
words
had
hardly
passed
his
lips
when
the
lad
was
unceremoniously
brought
to
a
realization
of
his
mistake.
There
was
a
whiz
and
a
crash
and
a
small
box
dropped
to
the
floor
within
a
foot
of
him.
He
lost
no
time
in
shifting
his
position.

"Aha!
two
can
play
at
that
game,"
he
muttered.

Picking
up
a
similar
object,
he
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
it
haphazard
when
he
became
aware
of
a
loud
knocking
in
the
direction
of
the
door.
Almost
frantic
with
relief
and
joy,
he
dropped
the
missile
and
started
toward
the
spot.

Fortunately
gaining
the
little
apartment
without
mishap,
he
inserted
his
key
in
the
lock
with
trembling
hands,
and
attempted
to
turn
it.
Just
then
a
maudlin
voice
came
from
outside:

"Phwere
is
the
lock,
Oi
wonder?
By
the
whiskers
av
St.
Patrick,
Oi
never
saw
such
a
night.
Cronin,
ye
divil,
yer
fuller
than
Duffy's
goat.
But
ye
are
a
good
fellow.







"'So
Oi
seized
th'
capstan
bar,





Like
a
true
honest
tar,





And
in
spite----'


"Murther!
Oi
can't
git
in
at
all,
at
all.
Oi'll
go
back
to
the
bottle.
Me
new
friend
has--hic--left
me,
but
Oi
have
his
whiskey.
Here
goes
for
th'
house
once
more."

Disgusted
at
the
discovery
that
it
was
only
the
tipsy
watchman,
Nattie
had
again
made
his
way
back
into
the
"go-down"
proper.
As
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
door
leading
from
the
office,
he
heard
the
rattling
of
iron.

The
sound
came
from
the
far
end.
A
second
later
there
was
a
faint
crash,
and
a
gust
of
wind
swept
through
the
vast
apartment.

"He
has
opened
a
window.
He
is
trying
to
escape."

Throwing
all
caution
away,
the
lad
recklessly
dashed
down
the
central
passageway.
It
did
not
take
him
long
to
reach
the
spot.
The
fury
of
the
storm
caused
the
opened
shutter
to
swing
back
and
forth
with
a
melancholy
grinding
of
the
hinges.

Climbing
upon
the
sill,
Nattie
slipped
through
the
opening
and
dropped
outside.
He
had
barely
reached
the
ground
when
he
was
suddenly
seized,
and,
with
a
fierce
effort,
sent
staggering
across
the
walk
separating
the
building
from
the
canal.

He
made
a
frantic
effort
to
save
himself,
but
it
was
too
late.
With
a
shrill
cry
trembling
upon
his
lips,
he
felt
himself
falling
through
space;
then,
with
a
loud
splash,
he
struck
the
water's
surface!




CHAPTER
XIII.

WILLIS
ROUND
ESCAPES.


No
man,
or
boy,
for
that
matter,
knows
just
what
he
can
do
until
put
to
the
test.
We
may
think
we
know
the
limit
of
our
strength
or
endurance,
but
we
cannot
prove
it
until
an
emergency
arises.
Then
we
are
often
found
mistaken
in
our
previous
surmises,
and,
need
it
be
said,
much
to
our
amazement.

Nature
is
a
wise
mother.
She
has
provided
in
all
a
reserve
force
which
only
needs
the
touch
of
an
exigency
to
cause
it
to
appear
full
powered.
A
task
is
set
before
you--you
cannot
do
it
in
your
opinion;
but
you
try--and
succeed.
You
are
in
peril;
only
a
miracle
of
strength
or
shrewdness
will
save
you.
Involuntarily
you
act,
and,
lo!
the
miracle
comes
from
your
good
right
arm
or
your
brain.

A
lad
learning
to
swim
places
a
dozen
yards
as
the
extent
of
his
powers.
He
enters
the
water;
is
carried
beyond
his
depth;
swept
away
by
an
undertow,
and
swims
successfully
the
length
of
three
city
blocks.
It
was
his
reserve
force
and
the
stimulating
fear
of
death
that
brought
him
safely
to
shore.

When
Nattie
Manning
felt
himself
falling
into
the
canal,
sent
there
by
Willis
Round's
cunning
arm,
he
realized
only
one
emotion,
and
that
was
rage--overpowering,
consuming
anger.
He
was
wild
with
wrath
to
think
that
he
had
been
tricked
by
the
ex-bookkeeper,
and
the
flames
of
his
passion
were
not
lessened
by
discomfiture.

It
seemed
that
he
had
barely
touched
the
water
before
he
was
out,
climbing
hand
over
hand
up
the
jagged
stone
side.
To
this
day
he
does
not
know
how
he
emerged
so
quickly,
or
by
what
latent
force
of
muscle
he
dragged
himself
to
the
passageway.

He
gained
the
spot,
however,
and,
thoroughly
saturated
with
water,
set
out
at
the
top
of
his
speed
after
his
assailant,
whose
shadowy
figure
scurried
along
in
front
of
him
toward
the
bay.
What
the
lad
hoped
to
accomplish
he
could
not
well
tell
himself,
but
he
continued
the
pursuit
with
the
keen
determination
of
a
bloodhound.

A
short
distance
back
of
the
"go-down,"
a
narrow
street
ran
from
the
bluff
to
the
center
of
the
city.
It
crossed
the
canal
with
the
aid
of
a
low
bridge,
and
was
occupied
by
storehouses.

The
storm
was
passing
away.
The
rain
had
slackened
perceptibly,
and
the
wind
had
died
down
to
occasional
puffs.
In
the
south
lightning
could
still
be
seen,
but
it
was
the
mere
glowing
of
atmospheric
heat.

In
that
part
of
Yokohama
devoted
to
mercantile
warehouses,
the
street
lamps
were
few
and
far
between.
There
was
one
at
the
junction
of
the
bridge
and
passageway,
however,
and
when
Nattie
dashed
into
its
circle
of
illumination,
he
suddenly
found
himself
confronted
by
a
uniformed
policeman.

The
latter
immediately
stretched
out
his
arms
and
brought
the
lad
to
a
halt.
Then
drawing
his
short-sword,
he
demanded
in
peremptory
tones
the
meaning
of
his
haste.
Seeing
the
futility
of
resisting
the
official,
Nattie
hurriedly
made
known
his
identity,
and
explained
the
events
of
the
night.

Brief
as
was
the
delay,
when
the
two
started
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitive,
enough
time
had
been
wasted
to
permit
him
to
escape.
A
hasty
search
of
the
neighborhood
brought
no
results.
Willis
Round
was
out
of
reach.

"No
matter,"
remarked
the
lad,
at
last.
"I
know
him,
and
it
won't
be
difficult
to
apprehend
the
scoundrel."

Returning
to
the
"go-down"
with
the
officer,
he
closed
the
window
and
then
dispatched
the
man
to
the
nearest
messenger
office
with
a
note
for
Grant.
In
due
time
the
police
official
returned
with
assistance.
Patrick
Cronin
was
found
helplessly
intoxicated
in
a
nearby
house,
and
unceremoniously
lugged
away
to
jail.

The
lame
youth
was
prompt
in
his
appearance
on
the
scene.
He
brought
with
him
a
servant
of
the
family,
who
was
installed
as
watchman
until
the
morrow.
Relieved
from
his
responsibility,
Nattie
accompanied
his
brother
home,
and
after
explaining
the
affair
in
detail,
proceeded
to
take
the
rest
he
needed
for
the
wrestling
match
of
the
next
day.

On
reporting
at
the
office
the
following
morning,
he
found
Grant
and
Mori
still
discussing
Willis
Round's
actions.
A
report
from
the
police
stated
that
nothing
had
been
accomplished.
The
fugitive
was
still
at
liberty,
and
in
all
probability
had
left
the
city.

"I'll
wager
a
_yen_
he
is
speeding
as
fast
as
the
train
can
carry
him
to
either
Nagasaki
or
Kobe,"
remarked
Mori.
"He'll
try
to
get
a
ship
and
leave
the
country."

Grant
shook
his
head
doubtfully.

"In
my
opinion,
he
will
not
do
that,"
he
said.
"There
are
too
many
places
in
the
interior
where
he
can
hide
until
this
affair
blows
over."

"If
the
scoundrel
ever
shows
his
face
in
Yokohama
I'll
see
that
he
is
placed
behind
the
bars,"
exclaimed
Nattie,
vindictively.
"He
deserves
little
mercy
at
our
hands.
If
an
all-wise
Providence
had
not
sent
me
to
the
'go-down'
last
night
we
would
now
be
considerably
out
of
pocket."

"What
will
we
do
with
Patrick
Cronin?"

"Discharge
him;
that's
all.
We
can't
prove
any
connection
with
Round.
The
latter
simply
tempted
him
away
from
his
duty
with
a
bottle
of
whiskey.
It
will
be
impossible
to
bring
a
criminal
charge
against
the
Irishman."

"I
will
see
that
he
remains
in
jail
for
a
couple
of
weeks,
anyway,"
decided
Grant.
"He
deserves
some
punishment."

"When
shall
we
close
up?"
asked
Nattie,
gayly.
"This
is
a
great
holiday,
you
know.
We
are
due
at
the
race
track
by
ten."

"It's
a
quarter
past
nine
now,"
replied
the
young
Japanese,
looking
at
his
watch.
"Suppose
we
start
at
once?"

The
suggestion
was
acted
upon
with
alacrity.
Leaving
the
office
in
charge
of
a
native
watchman,
the
three
youths
took
_jinrikishas_
and
proceeded
to
the
"bluff,"
where
the
sports
of
the
day
were
to
take
place.

The
storm
of
the
preceding
night
had
ended
in
delightful
weather.
The
tropical
rays
of
the
sun
were
tempered
by
a
cooling
breeze
from
the
bay.
The
air
was
glorious
with
briskness,
and
so
clear
that
the
majestic
peak
of
Fuji
San
seemed
within
touch.

The
city
was
in
gala
attire.
Banners
of
all
nations
were
flaunting
in
the
breeze,
but
after
the
Japanese
flag
of
the
Rising
Sun,
the
grand
old
Stars
and
Stripes
predominated.
It
could
not
be
said
that
the
firm
of
Manning
Brothers
&
Okuma
had
failed
in
patriotism.

Streaming
from
a
lofty
flagstaff
on
the
roof
was
an
immense
American
ensign,
and
draping
the
_façade_
of
the
building
were
others
intertwined
with
the
standard
of
the
country.
The
streets
were
decorated
with
arches
and
bunting,
and
every
second
native
wore
a
little
knot
of
red,
white
and
blue.

It
was
a
unique
celebration,
from
one
point
of
view.
Many
years
before,
the
gallant
Commodore
Perry
had
sailed
into
the
Bay
of
Yokohama
with
a
message
of
good
will
from
the
then
President
of
the
United
States
to
the
ruler
of
Japan.

At
that
time
the
island
kingdom
was
walled
in
by
impassable
bulwarks
of
exclusiveness
and
hatred
of
foreigners.
For
thousands
of
years
she
had
calmly
pursued
her
course
of
life,
lost
to
civilization,
and
satisfied
with
her
reign
of
idols
and
depths
of
barbarism.

It
required
a
strong
hand
to
force
a
way
to
the
central
power,
and
time
waited
until
the
Yankee
commodore
appeared
with
his
fleet
of
ships.
Other
nations
had
tried
to
pierce
the
barrier.
England,
France,
Germany
made
repeated
attempts,
but
were
repulsed.

The
Dutch
secured
a
foothold
of
trade,
but
on
the
most
degrading
terms.
Their
representatives
were
compelled
to
approach
the
mikado
and
grovel
upon
their
knees
with
heads
bowed
in
the
dust.
In
this
debasing
attitude
were
they
greeted
with
the
contempt
they
deserved,
and
as
slaves
to
Japan.

Much
as
Americans
desired
commercial
relations
with
the
country,
they
would
not
accept
them
with
humility.
In
the
selection
of
an
envoy
the
United
States
could
not
have
decided
on
a
better
man
than
Commodore
Perry,
brother
of
the
hero
of
Lake
Erie.

Firm,
implacable,
intelligent,
and
generous
withal,
he
was
the
fitting
choice.
On
reaching
Japan
he
was
met
with
refusals
and
evasions.
He
persisted,
and
finally
the
august
ruler
sent
a
minor
official
to
confer
with
the
foreigner.

"I
am
here
as
personal
representative
of
the
United
States
of
America,
and
I
will
see
no
one
save
the
mikado
himself,
or
his
highest
official,"
replied
the
bluff
naval
officer.
"I
have
ten
ships
and
two
hundred
guns,
and
here
I
stay
until
I
am
received
with
the
formalities
due
my
President."

He
finally
won
the
point,
and
after
the
usual
delay,
a
treaty
was
made
between
the
two
countries,
to
the
amazement
of
the
civilized
world.
This
was
the
entering
wedge
which
resulted
in
the
Japan
of
to-day.
Lifted
from
her
barbarism,
she
has
reached
a
high
plane
among
nations.
Small
wonder
that
her
people
celebrate
the
anniversary,
and
honor
the
memory
of
the
immortal
Commodore
Perry.

With
apologies
for
this
digression,
I
will
again
take
up
the
thread
of
the
story.




CHAPTER
XIV.

THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
CELEBRATION.


_En
route_
to
the
"bluff"
the
boys
came
upon
a
curious
procession.
As
stated
above,
the
whole
town
was
enjoying
a
_matsura_,
or
festival.
As
Nattie
aptly
remarked,
it
was
the
Fourth
of
July,
Decoration
Day
and
Christmas
thrown
into
one.

In
the
present
case
the
spectacle
was
one
calculated
to
make
a
foreigner
imagine
himself
in
the
interior
of
Africa.
Approaching
the
_jinrikishas_
occupied
by
Grant
and
his
companions
was
a
bullock
cart,
upon
which
a
raised
platform
and
scaffolding
twenty
feet
high
had
been
constructed.

The
bullock
and
all
were
covered
with
paper
decorations,
green
boughs
and
artificial
flowers.
In
front
a
girl
with
a
grotesque
mask
danced
and
postured,
while
a
dozen
musicians
twanged
impossible
instruments
and
kept
up
an
incessant
tattoo
on
drums.

On
foot
around
the
_bashi_,
as
the
whole
structure
is
called,
were
twenty
or
thirty
lads
naked
as
to
their
legs,
their
faces
chalked,
their
funny
little
heads
covered
with
straw
hats
a
yard
wide,
and
their
bodies
clad
in
many-colored
tunics,
decked
out
with
paper
streamers
and
flowers.

In
front,
on
all
sides,
behind,
and
even
under
the
wheels,
were
scores
of
children
marching
to
the
tune
of
the
band--if
it
could
be
so
called--much
as
the
youths
of
America
do
in
the
processions,
be
it
circus
or
otherwise,
in
our
country.

The
boys
forming
the
guard
to
the
bullock
cart
marched
step
by
step
with
military
precision,
chanting
at
the
top
of
their
voices,
and
banging
upon
the
ground
a
long
iron
bar
fitted
with
loose
rings.

The
colors,
the
songs,
the
dance
and
the
clanging
iron,
formed
together
a
combination
calculated
to
draw
the
attention
of
every
person
not
deaf,
dumb
and
blind.
To
the
boys
it
was
a
common
sight,
and
they
bade
their
_karumayas_
hurry
forward
away
from
the
din.

On
reaching
the
field
on
the
"bluff,"
they
found
an
immense
throng
awaiting
the
commencement
of
ceremonies.
The
race
track
had
been
laid
out
in
fitting
style,
and
innumerable
booths,
tents
and
_kiosks_
filled
two-thirds
of
the
space.

The
morning
hours
were
to
be
devoted
to
ancient
Japanese
games,
and
the
time
after
tiffin
to
modern
sports
and
matches,
including
the
event
of
the
day,
the
wrestling.
Mori
Okuma--an
athlete
in
both
European
and
native
sports--was
listed
in
a
bout
at
Japanese
fencing,
so
he
left
his
companions
for
a
dressing-tent.

Nattie
and
Grant
glanced
over
the
vast
concourse
of
people,
and
exchanged
bows
with
their
many
friends.
The
Americans
and
English
in
foreign
countries
keep
green
in
their
memory
the
land
of
their
birth,
and
in
all
places
where
more
than
one
foreigner
can
be
found
a
club
is
organized.

It
is
a
sort
of
oasis
in
the
desert
of
undesirable
neighbors,
and
forms
a
core
around
which
cluster
good
fellowship
and
the
habits
and
customs
of
home.
The
Strangers'
Club
in
Yokohama
had
a
membership
of
six
hundred,
and
they
were
well
represented
in
the
present
assemblage.

Grant
and
Nattie
were
well-known
members,
and
they
counted
their
friends
by
the
hundred.
In
looking
over
the
field
the
latter
espied
a
group
in
the
grand
stand
which
immediately
attracted
his
attention.
He
pointed
them
out
to
his
brother.

"There
is
Mr.
Black
and
the
two
German
merchants,"
he
said.
"They
have
their
heads
together
as
if
discussing
some
weighty
problem.
I
wonder
where
Ralph
is?
He
is
interested
in
athletics."

"I'll
wager
a
_yen_
he
is
about
somewhere.
So
the
Germans
are
hobnobbing
with
our
esteemed
enemy,
eh?
I'll
warrant
we
are
the
subject
of
conversation.
I
don't
like
the
way
Swartz
and
Bauer
conduct
business,
and
I
guess
they
know
it.
They
can
form
an
alliance
if
they
wish
to.
We
needn't
lose
any
sleep
over
it."

"There
comes
Ralph.
He
is
looking
in
this
direction.
I
wonder
what
he
thinks
about
the
failure
of
his
confederate,
Willis
Round,
to
injure
us?
To
the
deuce
with
them,
anyway!
The
fencing
is
about
to
commence."

The
clapping
of
hands
and
a
prolonged
cheer
proclaimed
the
beginning
of
the
sports.
The
_yobidashi_,
or
caller-out,
took
his
stand
upon
a
decorated
box,
and
announced
a
bout
at
fencing
between
the
ever-pleasant
and
most
worthy
importing
merchant,
Mori
Okuma,
and
the
greatly-to-be-admired
doctor-at-law,
Hashimoto
Choye.

At
the
end
of
this
ceremonious
proclamation
he
introduced
our
friend
and
his
antagonist.
Both
were
small
in
stature,
and
they
presented
rather
a
comical
appearance.
Each
was
padded
out
of
all
proportions
with
folds
of
felt
and
leather.
Upon
their
heads
were
bonnet-shaped
helmets
of
metal,
and
each
wore
a
jacket
of
lacquered
pieces
decidedly
uncomfortable
to
the
eye.

At
the
word
of
command
attendants
rushed
in
with
the
weapons.
These
were
not
broadswords,
rapiers,
nor
cutlasses,
but
a
curious
instrument
composed
of
a
number
of
strips
of
bamboo,
skillfully
wrought
together
and
bound.
The
end
was
covered
with
a
soft
skin
bag,
and
the
handle
was
very
much
like
that
of
an
ordinary
sword.

Armed
with
these
the
combatants
faced
each
other,
and
at
the
sound
of
a
mellow
bell
fell
to
with
the
utmost
ferocity.
Slash,
bang,
whack,
went
the
weapons;
the
fencers
darted
here
and
there,
feinted,
prodded,
cut
and
parried,
as
if
they
had
to
secure
a
certain
number
of
strikes
before
the
end
of
the
bout.

It
was
all
very
funny
to
those
unaccustomed
to
the
Japanese
style
of
fencing,
and
the
naval
officers
from
the
various
warships
in
port
roared
with
laughter.
To
the
natives
it
was
evidently
deeply
interesting,
and
they
watched
the
rapid
play
of
the
weapons
as
we
do
the
gyrations
of
our
favorite
pitcher
in
the
national
game.

At
the
end
of
five
minutes
the
game
was
declared
finished.
The
umpire,
an
official
of
the
city
government,
decided
in
favor
of
Mori,
and
that
youth
fled
to
the
dressing-tent
to
escape
the
plaudits
of
the
audience.
He
received
the
congratulations
of
Grant
and
Nattie
with
evident
pleasure,
however.

The
next
item
on
the
programme
was
a
novel
race
between
trained
storks.
Then
came
a
creeping
match
between
a
score
of
native
youngsters,
and
so
the
morning
passed
with
jugglery
and
racing
and
many
sports
of
the
ancient
island
kingdom.

At
noon
tiffin
was
served
to
the
club
and
its
guests
in
a
large
pavilion
placed
in
the
center
of
the
grounds.
The
ceremonies
recommenced
at
two
o'clock
with
a
running
match
between
a
dozen
trained
athletes.
Of
all
the
spectators,
probably
the
happiest
was
Grant
Manning.

Deprived
of
participation
in
the
various
sports
by
his
deformity,
he
seemed
to
take
a
greater
interest
from
that
very
fact.
He
clapped
his
hands
and
shouted
with
glee
at
every
point,
and
was
the
first
to
congratulate
the
winners
as
they
left
the
track.

The
time
for
the
great
event
of
the
day
finally
arrived.
At
three
the
master
of
ceremonies,
clad
in
_kamishimo_,
or
ancient
garb,
mounted
his
stand
and
announced
in
stentorian
tones:

"The
next
event
on
the
programme
will
be
a
contest
in
wrestling
between
six
gentlemen
of
this
city.
Those
persons
whose
names
are
listed
with
the
secretary
will
report
in
the
dressing-tent."

"That
calls
me,"
cried
Nattie,
gayly.
"Boys,
bring
out
your
rabbits'
feet
and
your
lucky
coins."

"You
don't
know
the
name
of
your
antagonist?"
asked
Mori.

"No;
nor
will
I
until
we
enter
the
ring.
Small
matter.
I
feel
in
fine
trim,
and
I
intend
to
do
the
best
I
can.
So
long."

"Luck
with
you,
Nattie,"
called
out
all
within
hearing,
casting
admiring
glances
after
the
handsome,
athletic
lad.

Directly
in
front
of
the
grand
stand
a
ring
had
been
constructed
something
after
the
fashion
of
the
old-time
circus
ring.
The
surface
was
sprinkled
with
a
soft,
black
sand,
and
the
ground
carefully
leveled.
Overhead
stretched
a
canopy
of
matting,
supported
by
a
number
of
bamboo
poles
wrapped
in
red,
white
and
blue
bunting.

At
the
four
corners
of
the
arena
were
mats
for
the
judges,
and
in
the
center
an
umpire
in
gorgeous
costume
took
his
place.
By
permission
of
the
Nomino
Sakune
Jinsha
Society,
which
controls
the
national
game
of
wrestling
in
the
empire,
their
hereditary
judges
were
to
act
in
the
present
match.

After
Nattie
disappeared
in
the
dressing-tent
a
short
delay
occurred.
As
usual,
the
audience
indicated
their
impatience
with
shouts
and
calls,
and
the
ever-present
small
boy
made
shrill
noises
upon
various
quaint
instruments.

Suddenly
a
herald
with
a
trumpet
emerged
from
the
tent,
and
the
vast
concourse
became
quiet.
He
sounded
a
blast,
the
canvas
flaps
of
two
openings
were
pulled
aside,
and
two
lads
bare
as
to
chest
and
with
legs
clad
in
trunks
bounded
into
the
arena.

A
murmur
of
surprise
came
from
the
audience;
the
antagonists
faced
each
other,
and
then
glared
a
bitter
defiance.
From
one
entrance
had
come
Nattie
Manning,
and
from
the
other--Ralph
Black!




CHAPTER
XV.

THE
WRESTLING
MATCH.


Nattie's
several
encounters
with
the
younger
member
of
the
English
firm
had
been
duly
discussed
in
the
club,
and
the
discomfiture
of
the
elder
merchant
during
his
call
upon
Grant
had
been
a
toothsome
morsel
for
the
gossipers
of
the
city.

The
enmity
between
the
houses
of
Manning
and
Black
was
the
common
talk
among
the
foreigners
of
Yokohama.
They
were
aware
of
the
cause
of
the
trouble,
and
knew
the
suspicions
concerning
the
payment
of
the
now-famous
debt.

And
when
the
opening
of
the
flaps
in
the
dressing-tent
had
disclosed
the
youths
destined
to
face
each
other
for
the
supremacy
of
the
wrestling
ring,
a
murmuring
sound
rolled
through
the
concourse
like
the
echoes
of
a
passing
wind.

"It's
young
Black
and
Nattie
Manning!"
cried
more
than
one.
"Whew!
there
will
be
a
warm
tussle
now."

Over
in
one
corner
of
the
grand
stand
Grant
and
Mori
sat
in
amazement.
The
_dénouement_
was
entirely
unexpected
to
them.
Not
long
did
they
remain
silent.
Up
sprang
the
lame
youth,
his
kindly
face
glowing
with
excitement.
Mounting
a
vacant
chair
despite
his
infirmity,
he
shook
a
bundle
of
English
notes
in
the
air,
and
shouted:

"Ten
to
one
on
my
brother!
Ten
to
one!
ten
to
one!
Twenty
pounds
even
that
he
secures
the
first
two
points!
Whoop!
where
are
the
backers
of
the
other
side?
I'll
make
it
fifteen
to
one
in
five-pound
notes.
Who
will
take
the
bet?"

In
the
meantime
Mori
had
not
been
idle.
Forcing
his
way
directly
to
where
Mr.
Black
was
sitting
with
the
Germans,
he
shook
a
bag
of
coin
in
the
air,
and
dared
them
to
place
a
wager
with
him.
Following
his
example
came
half
a
dozen
American
friends
of
the
new
firm,
and
presently
the
grand
stand
resounded
with
the
cries
of
eager
bettors.

Down
in
the
arena
Nattie
and
Ralph
stood
confronting
one
another
like
tigers
in
a
forest
jungle.
The
former's
face
was
set
with
determination.
He
had
long
wished
for
just
such
an
opportunity.
It
had
come
at
last.

Ralph's
face
wore
a
peculiar
pallor.
It
was
not
fear,
but
rather
that
of
one
who
felt
the
courage
of
desperation.
He
well
knew
there
was
little
difference
in
physical
strength
between
them,
but
he
appeared
to
lack
the
stamina
of
honesty
and
merit.

Both
lads
were
in
the
pink
of
condition,
and
they
formed
a
picture
appealing
to
the
hearts
of
all
lovers
of
athletics.
There
was
not
an
ounce
of
superfluous
flesh
on
either.
If
anything,
Ralph
was
slightly
taller,
but
Nattie's
arms
gave
promise
of
greater
length
and
muscle.

Presently
the
din
in
the
grand
stand
ceased.
Wagers
had
been
given
and
taken
on
both
sides
with
great
freedom.
Grant
had
collapsed
into
a
chair
with
his
purse
empty
and
his
notebook
covered
with
bets.
Mori
was
still
seeking
takers
with
great
persistency.

A
blast
was
sounded
on
the
herald's
trumpet,
and
the
eyes
of
the
vast
audience
were
centered
on
the
ring.
The
judges
took
their
places,
the
umpire
hopped
to
the
middle,
and
with
a
wave
of
his
fan
gave
the
signal.

Nattie
and
Ralph
faced
each
other,
eye
to
eye.
Slowly
sinking
down
until
their
hands
rested
upon
their
knees,
they
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
grapple.

The
silence
was
intense.
The
far-away
echoes
of
a
steamer's
whistle
came
from
the
distant
bay.
A
chant
of
voices
sounding
like
the
murmur
of
humming-birds
was
wafted
in
from
a
neighboring
temple.
The
hoarse
croaking
of
a
black
crow--the
city's
scavenger--came
from
a
circling
figure
overhead.

A
minute
passed.

Nattie
straightened.
Ralph
followed
his
example.
Warily
they
approached
each
other.
Face
to
face,
and
eye
to
eye;
intent
upon
every
step,
they
began
to
march
sideways;
always
watching,
always
seeking
for
an
opening.
Their
hands
twitched
in
readiness
for
a
dash,
a
grip,
a
tug.

Each
had
his
weight
thrown
slightly
forward,
and
his
shoulders
slouched
a
little,
watching
for
an
unwary
move.
Nattie
feinted
suddenly.
His
right
arm
darted
out,
he
touched
Ralph's
shoulder,
but
the
English
youth
dodged,
only
to
be
grasped
by
the
waist
by
his
antagonist's
left
hand.

There
was
a
sharp
tug,
a
whirl
of
the
figures,
then
they
broke
away,
each
still
upon
his
feet.
A
vast
sigh
came
from
the
audience,
and
Grant
chuckled
almost
deliriously.

The
antagonists
rested,
still
confronting
each
other.
Ralph's
pallor
had
given
way
to
an
angry
flush.
His
lips
moved
as
if
muttering
oaths.
Nattie
remained
cool
and
imperturbable.
His
was
the
advantage.
Coolness
in
combat
is
half
the
battle.
Those
in
the
audience
that
had
risked
their
money
upon
the
merchant's
son
began
to
regret
their
actions.

The
match
was
not
won,
however.

At
the
end
of
five
minutes
a
signal
came
from
the
umpire.
Before
the
flash
of
his
brilliantly
decorated
fan
had
vanished
from
the
eyes
of
the
audience,
Nattie
darted
forward
and
clashed
breast
to
breast
against
Ralph.

The
latter
put
forth
his
arms
blindly,
gropingly;
secured
a
partial
hold
of
his
opponent's
neck,
essayed
a
backward
lunge,
but
in
the
hasty
effort
stumbled
and
suddenly
found
himself
upon
his
back
with
the
scattering
gusts
of
sand
settling
around
him.

And
then
how
the
grand
stand
rang
with
cheers!

"First
bout
for
Manning!"

"A
fair
fall,
and
a
great
one!"

High
above
the
tumult
of
sounds
echoed
a
shrill
voice:

"Thirty
to
one
on
my
brother!
I
offer
it
in
sovereigns!
Take
it
up
if
you
dare!"

The
victor
stood
modestly
bowing
from
side
to
side,
but
there
was
a
glitter
of
pride
in
his
eyes
which
told
of
the
pleasure
he
felt--doubly
a
pleasure,
because
his
antagonist
was
Ralph
Black.

The
latter
had
been
assisted
to
his
feet
by
the
men
appointed
for
the
purpose.
He
was
trembling
in
every
limb,
but
it
was
from
rage,
not
exhaustion.
His
breath
came
in
short,
quick
gasps,
and
he
glared
at
Nattie
as
if
meditating
an
assault.

Again
the
umpire's
fan
gave
the
signal,
and
once
more
the
combatants
faced
each
other
for
the
second
point.
And
now
happened
a
grievous
thing
for
our
heroes.

Nattie
was
not
ordinarily
self-assured.
There
was
no
room
in
his
character
for
conceit;
but
his
triumph
in
the
present
case
caused
him
to
make
a
very
serious
mistake.

He
failed
at
this
critical
moment
to
bear
in
mind
Moltke's
famous
advice:
"He
who
would
win
in
war
must
put
himself
in
his
enemy's
place."
Flushed
with
his
victory
he
entered
into
the
second
bout
with
a
carelessness
that
brought
him
to
disaster
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye.

Ralph
Black,
smarting
under
defeat,
kept
his
wits
about
him,
however,
and,
adopting
his
opponent's
tactics,
made
a
fierce
rush
at
the
instant
of
the
signal.
Grasping
Nattie
by
the
waist,
he
forced
him
aside,
and
then
backward
with
irresistible
force.

The
result--the
lad
found
himself
occupying
almost
the
same
spot
of
earth
which
bore
Ralph's
former
imprint.
Now
was
the
time
for
the
opposition
to
cheer,
and
that
they
did
right
royally.
Counter
shouts
came
from
the
American
faction,
and
again
Grant
and
Mori's
voices
arose
above
the
tumult
inviting
wagers.

Five
minutes
of
rest,
then
came
the
time
for
the
final
and
decisive
bout.

It
was
with
very
different
feelings
that
Nattie
passed
to
the
center
of
the
ring
now.
His
handsome
face
plainly
bespoke
humiliation,
but
there
was
a
flash
of
the
eyes
which
also
announced
a
grim
and
desperate
determination.
It
was
like
that
of
Ben
Hur
when
he
swept
around
the
arena
with
his
chargers
on
the
last
circle.

Ralph
was
plainly
elated.
He
paused
long
enough
to
wave
one
hand
toward
a
group
of
friends;
then
the
twain
faced
for
the
last
time.
It
was
evident
from
the
outset
that
the
bout
would
not
last
very
long.

Warily,
and
with
the
utmost
caution,
the
lads
confronted
each
other.
Side
by
side
they
edged
and
retreated.
A
silence
as
of
the
tombs
of
forgotten
races
fell
upon
the
audience.

Suddenly--no
man's
eyes
were
quick
enough
to
see
the
start--Nattie
dropped
almost
on
all
fours
at
Ralph's
feet.
He
lunged
forward,
grasped
the
English
youth's
hips,
then
with
a
mighty
effort
which
brought
the
blood
in
a
scarlet
wave
to
his
face,
he
surged
upward,
and,
with
a
crash,
the
merchant's
son
lay
a
motionless
heap
in
the
center
of
the
arena!

And
the
match
was
won!




CHAPTER
XVI.

AFTER
THE
VICTORY.


The
match
was
won,
and
Nattie
had
come
out
victorious.
There
was
an
instant
of
silence
after
the
clever
throw--silence
like
that
which
precedes
a
storm--then
the
grounds
rang
with
a
tumult
of
applause.

With
shouts
and
yells,
with
clapping
of
hands
and
piercing
whistles
the
vast
audience
proclaimed
their
appreciation.
Men
nearer
the
ring
climbed
over
the
low
railing
and
lifting
the
blushing
lad
to
their
shoulders,
formed
the
nucleus
of
a
triumphal
procession.

Around
the
arena
they
marched
until
at
last
Nattie
struggled
free
by
main
force.
Retreating
to
the
dressing-tent,
he
disappeared
within
its
shelter,
followed
by
Grant
and
Mori.
The
latter
were
so
filled
with
joy
that
they
could
not
find
qualifying
words
in
either
language,
so
they
shouted
alternately
in
Japanese
and
English.

In
the
meantime
the
defeated
wrestler
had
been
brought
to
a
realization
of
his
discomfiture
by
his
father
and
several
surgeons.
The
fall
had
stunned
him,
but
no
bones
were
broken.
Leaning
on
his
parent,
he
retired
to
a
_jinrikisha_
and
left
the
field
without
changing
his
costume.

In
the
dressing-tent
Nattie
and
his
companions
were
holding
gay
carnival
over
the
victory.
The
little
apartment
was
crowded
with
Americans,
both
civilian
and
naval,
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
triumph
was
being
regarded
as
an
international
affair.
It
was
a
victory
of
the
American
element
over
the
English.

The
difference
between
Nattie
and
Ralph
had
given
way
to
something
of
greater
importance.
Through
some
unexplained
reason
a
strong
undercurrent
of
jealousy
exists
between
members
of
the
two
countries
in
foreign
climes,
and
evidences
crop
to
the
surface
at
intervals.

It
generally
manifests
itself
in
just
such
occasions
as
the
present,
and
from
the
moment
Nattie
and
Ralph
were
matched
together
in
the
arena,
the
American
and
English
took
sides
with
their
respective
countrymen.

The
overwhelming
importance
of
the
first
match
detracted
all
interest
from
those
following,
and
the
celebration
was
soon
brought
to
a
close.
Nattie
and
his
companions
finally
escaped
from
the
field.
At
Grant's
invitation
a
number
of
the
Americans
accompanied
him
to
a
well-known
tea
house
in
the
city
where
dinner
was
served
in
honor
of
the
occasion.

Of
course
the
victor
was
the
lion
of
the
feast,
but
he
bore
his
honors
modestly.
On
being
called
upon
for
a
speech
he
displayed
greater
trepidation
than
when
he
confronted
his
antagonist
in
the
arena.
At
last
yielding
to
the
vociferous
invitation,
he
arose
from
his
chair
and
said,
bluntly:

"I
am
no
hand
to
talk,
my
friends.
In
our
firm
my
Brother
Grant
is
my
mouthpiece.
But
I
can
say
that
I
appreciate
this
honor,
and
that
I
am
almighty
glad
I
defeated
Ralph
Black.
I
guess
you
know
the
reason
why.
I
thank
you
for
your
kindness."

Then
he
abruptly
resumed
his
seat,
amid
the
cheers
of
the
party
who
voted
him
a
good
fellow
with
the
enthusiasm
of
such
occasions.
The
impromptu
banquet
came
to
an
end
in
due
time,
and
the
coming
of
the
morrow
found
the
boys
again
at
work
in
the
counting-room
of
Manning
Brothers
&
Okuma.

It
was
with
a
chuckle
of
great
satisfaction
that
Grant
counted
up
the
results
of
his
wagers
made
in
the
grand
stand.
He
checked
off
each
item
with
glee,
and
finally
announced
to
his
companions
that
he
was
three
hundred
pounds
ahead.

"I
don't
care
a
broken
penny
for
the
money,"
he
said.
"In
fact,
I
intend
to
turn
it
over
to
the
hospital
fund,
but
it's
the
fact
of
beating
those
Englishmen
that
tickles
me.
Nattie,
if
you
had
permitted
Ralph
Black
to
throw
you
in
that
last
bout
I
would
have
disowned
you
and
retired
to
a
Shinton
monastery."

"My,
what
a
fate
I
saved
you
from!"
grinned
his
brother.
"Fancy
you
a
monk
with
that
hoppity-skip
foot
of
yours.
But
how
is
Ralph?
Have
either
of
you
heard?"

"Some
one
told
me
this
morning
that
he
was
feeling
very
sore--in
spirits,"
laughed
Mori.
"They
say
he
took
the
early
train
for
Kobe,
where
he
intends
to
stay
until
his
humiliation
has
a
chance
to
disappear."

"I'll
wager
a
_yen_
yesterday's
work
has
not
increased
his
liking
for
us,"
carelessly
remarked
the
lame
youth.
"What
did
you
get
out
of
his
father
and
those
Germans,
Mori?
I
saw
you
hovering
about
them
with
a
bag
of
coin.
Did
the
old
man
do
any
betting?"

"Five
hundred
dollars.
I
gave
him
odds
of
seven
to
one.
I
also
have
the
German
merchants,
Swartz
and
Bauer,
listed
for
a
cool
thousand.
Whew!
won't
they
groan
in
bitterness
of
spirit
when
I
send
over
for
the
money?"

"I
only
regret
one
thing
in
the
whole
affair,"
said
Nattie.
"And
that
is
my
confounded
carelessness
in
permitting
Ralph
to
throw
me
in
the
second
bout.
It
was
a
case
of
'swell-head,'
I
suppose.
The
first
throw
was
so
easy
I
thought
all
the
rest
would
be
like
it.
However,
all's
well
that
ends
well.
The
match
is
won,
and
the
English
will
sing
low
for
a
time."

During
the
balance
of
the
week
the
members
of
the
new
firm
labored
early
and
late
arranging
their
shipments
of
tea
and
silks.
Each
steamer
carried
a
consignment
of
goods
to
America,
and
in
return
came
cargoes
of
merchandise,
flour,
printed
goods,
machinery
and
wool.

The
events
of
the
past
few
days
had
advertised
the
firm
to
such
an
extent
that
the
volume
of
business
became
burdensome.
In
due
course
of
time
the
flood
of
money
turned
and
began
to
flow
back
into
the
coffers.
Bills
outstanding
at
short
periods
matured,
and
the
bank
account
assumed
healthy
proportions.

Mori
was
compelled
to
withdraw
his
last
loan
of
thirty
thousand
dollars,
given
at
a
most
critical
point
in
the
firm's
brief
existence
despite
his
protest.
At
the
end
of
the
third
week
two
extra
warehouses
were
leased,
and
the
clerical
force
in
the
office
doubled.

All
this
was
very
comforting
to
Grant
and
his
associates,
but
there
still
remained
a
more
valuable
prize.
The
rumors
of
war
between
China
and
Japan,
which
had
bubbled
to
the
surface
of
the
political
caldron
many
times
during
the
past
year,
now
began
to
attract
public
attention.

The
government
disclaimed
any
idea
of
impending
war,
but
it
quietly
proceeded
with
its
preparations
at
the
same
time.
It
was
known
among
the
merchants
that
a
large
order
for
arms
and
ammunition
would
be
given
out
on
the
first
day
of
August,
and
the
competition
became
very
keen.

Through
his
personal
friendship
with
the
secretary
of
war,
and
the
integrity
of
the
new
firm,
Grant
was
acknowledged
as
possessing
the
best
chance.
There
was
one
company,
however,
that
had
not
given
up
hope
of
securing
the
prize,
and
that
was
the
firm
of
Black
&
Son.

The
reader
will
doubtless
remember
the
meeting
held
in
the
English
merchant's
office
between
father
and
son
and
the
ex-bookkeeper,
Willis
Round.
At
that
consultation
the
latter
had
disclosed
a
plan
for
the
defeat
of
Grant
Manning.

The
affair
of
the
"go-down,"
when
Round
was
foiled
in
his
attempt
to
start
a
conflagration,
delayed
the
schemes
of
the
conspirators,
but
the
near
approach
of
the
time
for
awarding
the
valuable
contract,
again
found
them
at
work.

Mr.
Black
was
the
only
one
of
the
three
present
in
Yokohama.
Willis
Round
was
an
exile
for
obvious
reasons,
and
Ralph
chose
to
absent
himself
after
the
wrestling
match
on
the
seventh
of
July.
By
arrangement
the
twain
met
in
an
interior
village
north
of
the
capital,
where
they
schemed
and
plotted
for
the
downfall
of
their
enemies.

At
the
expiration
of
two
weeks
Patrick
Cronin
was
released
from
jail
and
advised
by
the
authorities
to
leave
the
country.
Thus
everything
promised
peace
for
our
heroes,
and
the
prosperity
of
honest
labor
fell
to
their
lot
day
by
day.

All
three
were
too
shrewd
to
allow
such
a
pleasant
state
of
affairs
to
lull
their
watchfulness.
They
knew
that
in
war
silence
is
ominous,
and
that
many
a
maneuver
is
projected
under
the
veil
of
a
temporary
truce.
As
it
came
to
pass,
however,
something
occurred
that
deceived
even
Nattie's
suspicious
eye.




CHAPTER
XVII.

THE
TURNING
UP
OF
A
BAD
PENNY
AND
ITS
RESULTS.


Nattie's
duties
as
warehouseman
and
shipper
of
the
firm
took
him
aboard
the
shipping
of
the
port
day
by
day.
When
a
consignment
of
tea
or
silk
was
conveyed
from
the
"go-down"
in
lighters
to
the
steamers
riding
at
anchor
in
the
bay,
the
lad
would
visit
the
vessels
to
see
that
the
goods
were
checked
properly.

Also
when
the
smaller
coasting
craft
would
arrive
from
other
ports
with
cargoes
from
the
local
agents
of
the
firm,
Nattie's
duty
carried
him
on
board
to
sign
the
receipts.

One
morning
while
on
the
latter
journey
to
a
coaster
from
Kobe
he
was
surprised
to
see
an
old
acquaintance
among
the
crew.
It
was
the
recreant
watchman,
Patrick
Cronin.

Still
harboring
resentment
for
the
fellow's
actions
on
that
memorable
night
when
Willis
Round
made
his
dastardly
attempt
to
fire
the
"go-down"
with
its
valuable
contents,
Nattie
passed
him
without
recognition.
After
attending
to
his
business
on
board,
he
started
to
leave
the
little
steamer.

As
he
was
preparing
to
descend
to
his
cutter,
he
felt
a
touch
upon
his
shoulder.
Turning,
he
saw
Patrick
with
an
expression
of
great
humility
upon
his
rugged
face.

"What
is
it?"
asked
Nattie,
sharply.

"I
beg
your
pardon,
sir,
but
could
Oi
have
a
bit
of
a
talk
wid
yer?"
replied
the
Irishman,
pleadingly.

"Well,
what
do
you
wish
to
say?
Make
haste;
I
am
in
a
hurry."

"Could
yer
step
back
here
a
bit
where
we
won't
be
overheard,
sir?
It's
something
of
interest
to
yourself
Oi
have
to
say,
sir.
Maybe
ye'll
think
it's
valuable
information
Oi
have
before
Oi'm
through."

Laughing
incredulously,
Nattie
walked
over
to
the
break
of
the
forecastle,
and
bade
his
companion
proceed
with
his
yarn.
He
thought
it
would
prove
to
be
a
sly
attempt
to
secure
another
position
with
the
firm,
and
he
firmly
intended
to
refuse
the
request.

"Now
what
is
it?"
he
again
demanded,
impatiently.

"It's
mad
ye
are
at
me,
Oi
suppose?"

"See
here,
Patrick
Cronin,
if
you
have
anything
to
tell
me,
speak
out.
My
time
is
too
valuable
to
waste
just
now.
If
you
intend
to
ask
for
a
situation
with
the
firm
you
had
better
save
your
breath.
One
experience
with
you
is
enough."

Instead
of
becoming
angry
at
this
plain
talk,
Patrick
set
to
chuckling
with
good
humor.

"Oi
don't
blame
yer
for
being
down
on
me,"
he
said,
with
what
seemed
very
like
a
wink.
"Oi
should
not
have
let
that
spalpane
tempt
me
wid
th'
drink.
Oi
have
it
in
for
him,
and
by
th'
same
token
that's
why
Oi'm
now
talking
to
yer."

"Do
you
know
where
Willis
Round
is?"
quickly
asked
Nattie.

"Maybe
Oi
do,
and
maybe
Oi
don't.
It's
for
you
to
say,
sir."

"For
me
to
say?
What
have
I
to
do
with
it?"

"Would
yer
like
to
capture
him?"
asked
Patrick,
cunningly.

Nattie
thought
a
moment
before
replying.
Would
it
really
be
worth
the
candle
to
bring
the
ex-bookkeeper
to
justice?
The
chase
might
entail
a
journey
and
some
expense.
But
then
would
it
not
be
advisable
for
the
sake
of
future
peace
to
have
Round
behind
prison
bars?

"As
long
as
he
is
at
liberty,"
thought
the
lad,
"we
can
expect
trouble.
This
chance
of
disarming
him
should
not
be
neglected."

"Yes;
I
would
very
much
like
to
capture
the
fellow,"
he
added,
aloud.
"I
suppose
you
know
where
he
is,
or
you
would
not
mention
the
subject."

"I
do
know
his
whereabouts
this
blessed
minute."

"Well?"

The
Irishman
leered
significantly.

"Ah,
you
wish
to
sell
the
information,
I
suppose?"
said
Nattie,
a
light
breaking
in
upon
him.

"It's
wise
ye
are."

"Can
you
tell
me
exactly
where
he
is,
so
that
I
can
send
and
have
him
arrested?"

"No,
no.
Ye
mustn't
send
the
police,
sir.
If
ye
want
to
capture
the
spalpane
ye
must
go
yerself,
or
wid
a
friend.
The
boobies
of
officers
would
spoil
everything.
If
Oi
give
the
man
away
Oi
must
be
sure
he
will
be
put
in
prison,
as
he'd
kill
me
for
informing
on
him."

"Oh,
I
see,"
said
Nattie,
contemptuously.
"You
wish
to
save
your
precious
skin.
Well,
if
it
is
worth
while
I'll
go
for
him
myself,
or
probably
take
Mori.
Now
where
is
he?"

"Is
the
information
worth
twenty
pounds,
sir?"

"No;
decidedly
not."

Patrick
looked
discomfited.

"But
think
of
th'
good
Oi'm
doing
yer,"
he
pleaded.
"Mister
Round
is
a
bad
man,
and
he'll
keep
yer
in
a
torment
of
suspense
until
ye
put
him
away.
Won't
ye
make
it
twenty
pounds,
sir?"

"No."

"Then
how
much?"

"Half
that
is
a
big
amount
for
the
information."

"Call
it
twelve
pounds,
and
it's
a
bargain."

"All
right;
but
understand,
you
are
not
to
get
a
cent
until
the
man
is
captured."

"Oh,
Oi'll
agree
to
that.
Oi'll
go
wid
yer
if
ye
pay
the
fare."

"Very
well.
Now
where
is
Willis
Round?"

"He's
stopping
in
Nagasaki."

"Nagasaki?
What
part?"

"That
Oi'll
show
yer
in
due
time.
He's
hid
away
in
a
place
ye
wouldn't
dream
of
lookin'
into.
When
do
you
want
to
start,
sir?"

"As
soon
as
possible.
We
can
leave
on
the
evening
train
and
reach
there
by
daylight.
Get
your
discharge
from
the
steamer
and
report
to
me
at
the
station
about
six
o'clock."

"And
who
will
ye
take
besides
me,
sir?
It'll
be
just
as
well
to
have
a
mate,
as
there's
no
telling
what'll
happen."

Nattie
eyed
the
speaker
keenly.

"So
you
think
there
will
be
no
trouble
in
effecting
the
capture,
eh?"
he
said.

"No;
but
it's
a
good
thing
to
be
prepared
in
this
worruld."

"There
is
more
truth
than
poetry
in
that,"
was
the
grim
reply.
"I
think
Mr.
Okuma
will
accompany
me.
He
intended
to
run
down
in
that
direction
before
long,
anyway.
Now
don't
fail,
Patrick.
Be
at
the
station
at
six."

The
ex-watchman
waved
his
hand
in
assent
as
the
lad
entered
his
boat,
then
he
retreated
to
the
forecastle
with
an
expression
of
great
satisfaction
upon
his
face.
During
the
balance
of
the
morning
he
proceeded
about
his
work
with
evident
good
humor.

Shortly
before
noon
he
borrowed
a
piece
of
paper
and
an
envelope
from
the
purser,
and
laboriously
indited
a
letter
with
the
stump
of
a
lead
pencil.
Sealing
the
epistle,
he
wrote
upon
the
back:







"MISTER
JESSE
BLACK,
ESQ.,











"The
Bund,
forninst
Main
Street,
























"Yokohammer,
Japan."


After
regarding
his
work
with
complacency,
he
asked
the
captain
for
his
discharge.
On
being
paid
off,
he
went
ashore
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
general
post
office.

In
the
meantime
Nattie
had
returned
to
the
office,
supremely
unconscious
of
Patrick's
duplicity.
He
found
Grant
and
Mori
making
up
the
invoices
for
a
cargo
of
lacquered
ware.
He
explained
his
news
at
once.

"It's
a
good
chance
to
strike
Black
&
Son
a
blow
they
will
be
not
likely
to
forget
in
a
hurry,"
he
added,
throwing
himself
into
a
chair.
"Perhaps
we
can
get
a
confession
from
the
fellow,
also."

"You
mean
about
that
debt?"
asked
Mori.

"Yes.
When
he
is
compelled
to
face
a
five
years'
sentence
for
attempted
arson
perhaps
he'll
'split'
on
his
confederates.
In
that
case
if
it
turns
out
as
we
suspect,
the
English
firm
will
be
wiped
out."

Grant
shook
his
head
doubtfully.

"I
do
not
like
the
source
of
your
information,
Nattie,"
he
said.
"In
my
opinion,
Patrick
Cronin
is
not
to
be
trusted."

"Oh,
he's
all
right.
He
has
it
in
for
Round
for
playing
him
such
a
trick,
and
he
is
trying
to
get
even.
Then
the
twelve
pounds
is
something
to
him."

"We
might
run
down
to
Nagasaki,"
thoughtfully
remarked
the
Japanese
youth.
"I
intended
to
drum
up
trade
in
that
direction,
anyway.
It
will
be
a
nice
little
trip,
even
if
nothing
comes
of
it."

"Something
tells
me
that
it
will
be
a
wild-goose
chase,"
replied
Grant.
"You
can
try
it,
though.
I
can
spare
both
of
you
for
three
or
four
days
about
now.
You
need
a
vacation,
anyway."

"What
about
yourself,
brother?"
asked
Nattie,
generously.
"You
have
worked
harder
than
either
of
us.
Why
can't
you
come
also?"

"What,
and
leave
the
business
go
to
the
dogs!
Oh,
no,
my
dear
boy.
What
would
I
do
with
a
vacation?
I
am
never
happier
than
when
I
am
pouring
over
accounts
in
this
office,
believe
me.
Get
away
with
you
now.
Run
home
and
pack
up
for
your
trip.
But
let
me
give
you
a
bit
of
advice."

"What
is
it?"

"Take
revolvers,
and
see
that
the
cartridges
are
in
good
condition.
Also,
don't
go
poking
about
the
suburbs
of
Nagasaki
without
a
squad
of
police."

"One
would
think
we
are
bound
after
a
band
of
outlaws
in
the
Indian
Territory
at
home,"
laughed
Nattie.
"Willis
Round
is
not
such
a
formidable
man
as
all
that."

"No;
but
you
don't
know
who
else
you
may
have
to
contend
with.
Another
thing:
keep
your
eye
on
Patrick
Cronin.
Good-by."

On
reaching
the
station
that
evening
Mori
and
Nattie
found
the
Irishman
awaiting
their
arrival.
He
was
all
smiles
and
good
humor,
and
his
rugged
face
was
as
guileless
as
that
of
a
new-born
babe.
Verily
the
human
countenance
is
not
always
an
index
to
one's
true
nature.

"It's
plazed
Oi
am
to
see
yer,
gentlemen,"
he
said,
suavely.
"I
did
think
ye
might
be
after
changing
yer
minds.
It's
near
train
time
now."

"We
are
here,"
replied
Nattie,
briefly.
"Get
into
the
car."

He
purchased
three
tickets,
for
Nagasaki
by
way
of
Kobe
and
followed
them
into
the
train.
A
moment
later
the
long
line
of
coaches
left
the
station
and
rolled
rapidly
on
into
the
night.

After
a
brief
stop
at
Kobe,
which
was
reached
shortly
before
daybreak,
the
train
resumed
its
course
along
the
edge
of
the
sea.
A
short
distance
from
the
city
the
tracks
were
laid
directly
upon
the
coast,
only
a
parapet
of
stone
separating
the
rails
from
the
water's
edge.

Feeling
restless
and
unable
to
sleep,
Nattie
left
his
bed,
and
throwing
on
his
outer
clothing,
stepped
out
upon
the
platform.
He
was
presently
joined
by
Mori,
and
the
twain
stood
watching
the
flitting
panorama.

A
storm,
which
had
been
gathering
in
the
south,
presently
broke,
lashing
the
broad
surface
of
the
sea
into
an
expanse
of
towering
waves.
As
the
gale
increased
in
force,
the
caps
of
water
began
to
break
over
the
parapet
in
salty
spray.

"Whew!
I
guess
we
had
better
beat
a
retreat,"
exclaimed
Mori,
after
receiving
an
extra
dash
of
moisture.

"Wait
a
moment,"
pleaded
Nattie.
"I
hate
to
leave
such
a
grand
scene.
What
a
picture
the
angry
seas
make!
My!
that
was
a
tremendous
wave!
It
actually
shook
the
train."

"Murder
and
saints!"
groaned
a
voice
at
his
elbow.
"Phwat
is
the
matter,
sir?
Is
it
going
to
sea
we
are
in
a
train
of
cars?
'Tis
the
first
time
Patrick
Cronin
ever
traveled
on
a
craft
without
masts
or
hull.
Oi
think
it
do
be
dangerous
along
here,
saving
yer
presence."

Before
either
Nattie
or
Mori
could
reply
to
the
evidently
truthful
remark,
a
line
of
water,
curling
upward
in
threatening
crests,
dashed
over
the
parapet
and
fairly
deluged
the
platforms.
It
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
the
three
could
retain
their
hold.

Now
thoroughly
alarmed,
they
endeavored
to
enter
the
car.
Suddenly
the
speed
of
the
train
became
lessened,
then
it
stopped
altogether.
A
moment
later
the
grinding
of
heavy
driving
wheels
was
heard,
and
the
line
of
coaches
began
to
back
up
the
track.
It
was
a
precaution
taken
too
late.

Before
the
cars
had
obtained
much
headway
a
wall
of
glistening
water
was
hurled
over
the
parapet
with
resistless
force,
sweeping
everything
before
it.
Amid
the
shouts
and
screams
of
a
hundred
victims
the
coaches
and
engine
were
tumbled
haphazard
from
the
track,
piling
up
in
a
mass
of
wreckage
against
the
cliff.




CHAPTER
XVIII.

EVIL
TIDINGS.


To
those
who
have
not
experienced
the
coming
of
sudden
disaster,
word
descriptions
are
feeble.
It
is
easy
to
tell
how
this
and
that
occurred;
to
speak
of
the
wails
and
cries
of
the
injured;
to
try
to
depict
the
scene
in
sturdy
English,
but
the
soul-thrilling
terror,
the
horror,
and
physical
pain
of
the
moment
must
be
felt.

In
the
present
case
the
accident
was
so
entirely
unexpected
that
the
very
occurrence
carried
an
added
quota
of
dreadful
dismay.
The
spot
had
never
been
considered
unsafe.
At
the
time
of
construction
eminent
engineers
had
decided
that
it
would
be
perfectly
feasible
to
lay
the
rails
close
to
the
edge
of
the
sea.

A
stout
parapet
of
stone
afforded
ample
protection,
in
their
opinion,
but
they
had
not
gauged
the
resistless
power
of
old
ocean.
The
coming
of
a
fierce
south
wind
worked
the
mischief,
and
in
much
less
time
than
is
required
in
the
telling,
the
doomed
train
was
cast
a
mass
of
wreckage
against
the
unyielding
face
of
the
cliff.

The
first
crash
extinguished
the
lights,
adding
impenetrable
darkness
to
the
scene.
It
found
Nattie
and
Mori
within
touch
of
each
other.
They
instinctively
grouped
together;
but
a
second
and
more
violent
wrench
of
the
coach
sent
them
flying
in
different
directions.

The
instinct
of
life
is
strong
in
all.
The
drowning
wretch's
grasp
at
a
straw
is
only
typical
of
what
mortals
will
do
to
keep
aglow
the
vital
spark.

Terror-stricken,
and
stunned
from
the
force
of
the
shock,
Nattie
still
fought
desperately
for
existence.
He
felt
the
coach
reeling
beneath
his
feet,
he
was
tossed
helplessly
like
a
truss
of
hay
from
side
to
side,
and
then
almost
at
his
elbow
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
shrieking:

"Mercy!
mercy!
The
blessed
saints
have
mercy
upon
a
poor
sinner.
Oi'm
sorry
for
me
misdeeds.
Oi
regret
that
Oi
was
even
now
going
against
the
law.
Oi
confess
that
Oi
meant
to
lead
them
two
young
fellows
away
so
that----"

The
words
ended
in
a
dreadful
groan
as
the
car
gave
a
violent
lurch,
then
Nattie
felt
a
shock
of
pain
and
he
lost
consciousness.
When
he
came
to,
it
was
to
find
the
bright
sun
shining
in
his
face.

It
was
several
moments
before
he
could
recognize
his
surroundings.
A
sound
as
of
persons
moaning
in
agony
brought
back
the
dreadful
truth.
He
found
himself
lying
upon
a
stretcher,
and
near
at
hand
were
others,
each
bearing
a
similar
burden.

The
temporary
beds
were
stretched
along
the
face
of
the
cliff.
A
dozen
feet
away
was
a
huge
mass
of
shattered
coaches
and
the
wreck
of
a
locomotive.
A
number
of
Japanese
were
still
working
amid
the
_débris_,
evidently
in
search
of
more
victims
of
the
disaster.

Nattie
attempted
to
rise,
but
the
movement
caused
him
excruciating
pain
in
the
left
shoulder.
A
native,
evidently
a
surgeon,
was
passing
at
the
moment,
and
noticing
the
action,
he
said,
with
a
smile
of
encouragement:

"Just
keep
quiet,
my
lad.
You
are
all
right,
merely
a
dislocation.
Do
not
worry,
we
will
see
that
you
are
well
taken
care
of."

"But
my
friend?"
replied
the
boy,
faintly.
"His
name
is
Mori
Okuma,
and
he
was
near
me
when
the
accident
occurred.
Can
you
tell
me
anything
of
him?
Is
he
safe?"

"Is
he
one
of
my
countrymen,
a
youth
like
yourself,
and
clad
in
tweed?"

"Yes,
yes."

"Well,
I
can
relieve
your
anxiety,"
was
the
cheering
reply.
"He
is
working
like
a
trooper
over
there
among
the
coaches.
It
was
he
who
rescued
you
and
brought
you
here.
Wait;
I
will
call
him."

A
moment
later
Mori
made
his
appearance,
but
how
sadly
changed
was
his
usually
neat
appearance.
His
hat
was
gone,
his
clothing
torn
and
disordered,
and
his
face
grimed
with
dust
and
dirt.
He
laughed
cheerily,
however,
on
seeing
Nattie,
and
made
haste
to
congratulate
him
on
his
escape.

"This
is
brave,"
he
exclaimed.
"You
will
soon
be
all
right,
old
boy.
No,
don't
try
to
get
up;
your
arm
is
dislocated
at
the
shoulder,
and
perfect
quiet
is
absolutely
necessary."

"But
I
can't
lie
here
like
a
stick,
Mori,"
groaned
the
lad.
"What's
a
dislocation,
anyway?
It
shouldn't
keep
a
fellow
upon
his
back."

"You
had
better
take
the
doctor's
advice.
The
relief
train
will
start
for
Kobe
before
long,
and
once
in
a
good
hotel,
you
can
move
about.
This
is
a
terrible
accident.
Fully
twenty
persons
have
lost
their
lives,
and
as
many
more
wounded."

"Have
you
seen
anything
of
Patrick
Cronin?"

"No,
nothing.
It
is
thought
several
bodies
were
carried
out
to
sea
when
the
water
rolled
back
after
tearing
away
the
parapet.
His
may
be
one
of
them."

The
Irishman's
words,
heard
during
the
height
of
the
turmoil,
returned
to
Nattie.
He
now
saw
the
significance
of
the
Irishman's
cry.

"Something
is
up,
Mori,"
he
said,
gravely,
explaining
the
matter.
"It
certainly
seems
as
if
Patrick
was
leading
us
on
a
wild-goose
chase."

"That
was
Grant's
impression,
anyway.
Did
the
fellow
really
use
those
words?"

"Yes,
and
he
evidently
told
the
truth.
He
was
in
fear
of
death,
and
he
confessed
aloud
that
he
was
leading
us
away
so
that
something
could
happen.
At
the
interesting
moment
his
voice
died
away
to
a
groan,
then
I
lost
consciousness."

"What
do
you
think
he
could
have
meant?"

"It
is
something
to
do
with
the
Blacks,
I'll
wager."

"But
does
he
know
them?"

"He
is
acquainted
with
Willis
Round,
and
that
is
the
same
thing."

Mori
seemed
doubtful.

"You
don't
think
he
intended
to
lead
us
into
a
trap?"
he
asked,
incredulously.

"Hardly,
but----"

"Grant?"

Nattie
sat
up
in
the
stretcher
despite
the
pain
the
effort
caused
him.

"Mori,
we
must
communicate
with
him
at
once,"
he
said.
"There
is
no
telling
what
could
happen
while
we
are
away.
Confound
it!
I'll
never
forgive
myself
if
this
should
prove
to
be
a
ruse.
Can
you
telegraph
from
here?"

"No,
we
must
wait
until
we
reach
Kobe.
Now
don't
excite
yourself,
my
dear
fellow.
You
will
only
work
into
a
fever,
and
that
will
retard
your
recovery.
I
really
think
we
are
mistaken.
But
even
if
it
should
prove
true,
it
won't
mend
matters
by
making
yourself
worse."

The
lad
fell
back
with
a
groan.
He
acknowledged
the
wisdom
of
Mori's
remark,
and
he
remained
quiet
until
the
relief
train
finally
carried
him
with
the
balance
of
the
survivors
to
the
city
they
had
recently
left.
Mori
hastened
to
the
telegraph
office
after
seeing
his
charge
to
a
hotel.

What
Nattie
suffered
in
spirit
during
the
Japanese
youth's
absence
can
only
be
measured
by
the
great
love
he
bore
his
crippled
brother.
The
very
thought
that
something
had
happened
to
him
was
anguish.
He
knew
that
Grant
was
bravery
itself
despite
his
physical
disability,
and
that
he
would
not
hesitate
to
confront
his
enemies
single-handed.

When
the
turning
of
the
door
knob
proclaimed
Mori's
return,
Nattie
actually
bounded
from
the
bed
and
met
him
halfway.
One
glance
at
the
Japanese
youth's
face
was
enough.
Evil
news
was
written
there
with
a
vivid
brush.
In
one
hand
he
held
a
telegram,
which
he
gave
to
his
companion
without
a
word.




CHAPTER
XIX.

BAD
NEWS
CONFIRMED.


Nattie
took
the
telegram
with
a
sinking
heart.
He
had
already
read
disquieting
news
in
Mori's
face,
and
for
a
moment
he
fumbled
at
the
paper
as
if
almost
afraid
to
open
it.
Finally
mustering
up
courage,
he
scanned
the
following
words:







"Message
received.
Grant
cannot
be
found.
He
left
office
at
usual





time
last
night,
but
did
not
appear
at
his
home.
Have
done
nothing





in
the
matter
yet.
Wire
instructions.
Sorry
to
hear
of
accident."


It
was
signed
by
the
chief
bookkeeper,
a
Scotchman,
named
Burr.
He
was
a
typical
representative
of
his
race,
canny,
hard-headed,
and
thoroughly
reliable.
Sentiment
had
no
place
in
his
nature,
but
he
was
as
impregnable
in
honesty
as
the
crags
of
his
own
country.

Poor
Nattie
read
the
telegram
a
second,
then
a
third
time.
The
words
seemed
burned
into
his
brain.
There
could
be
only
one
meaning:
Grant
Manning
had
met
with
disaster.
But
where,
and
how?
And
through
whom?
The
last
question
was
easily
answered.

"Mori,"
he
said,
with
a
trembling
voice,
"this
is
the
work
of
the
Blacks
and
that
scoundrel,
Willis
Round."

"Something
may
have
happened,
but
we
are
not
yet
certain,"
gravely
replied
the
Japanese
youth.
"Surely
Grant
could
take
a
day
off
without
our
thinking
the
worse."

"You
do
not
know
my
brother,"
answered
the
lad,
steadfastly.
"He
hasn't
a
bad
habit
in
the
world,
and
the
sun
is
not
more
regular
than
he.
No,
something
has
happened,
and
we
must
leave
for
Yokohama
by
the
first
train."

"It
is
simply
impossible
for
you
to
go,"
expostulated
Mori.
"The
doctor
said
you
must
not
stir
from
bed
for
three
days
at
the
very
least.
I
will
run
down
at
once,
but
you
must
remain
here."

"If
the
affair
was
reversed,
Grant
would
break
the
bounds
of
his
tomb
to
come
to
me,"
Nattie
replied,
simply.
"Send
for
a
surgeon
and
ask
him
to
fix
this
shoulder
for
traveling.
I
want
to
leave
within
an
hour."

The
young
Japanese
threw
up
both
hands
in
despair,
but
he
left
without
further
words.
In
due
time
the
man
of
medicine
appeared
and
bandaged
the
dislocated
member.
A
few
moments
later
Nattie
and
Mori
boarded
the
train
for
the
north.

As
the
string
of
coaches
whirled
through
valley
and
dell,
past
paddy
fields
with
their
queer
network
of
ridges
and
irrigating
ditches;
past
groups
of
open-eyed
natives
dressed
in
the
quaint
blue
costumes
of
the
lower
classes;
through
small
clusters
of
thatched
bamboo
houses,
each
with
its
quota
of
cheerful,
laughing
babies,
tumbling
about
in
the
patches
of
gardens
much
as
the
babies
of
other
climes
do,
Nattie
fell
to
thinking
of
the
great
misfortune
which
had
overtaken
the
firm.

"If
something
has
happened
to
Grant--which
may
God
forbid--it
will
be
greatly
to
the
interest
of
Jesse
Black,"
he
said,
turning
to
his
companion.
"Everything
points
in
their
direction.
The
first
question
in
such
a
case
is,
who
will
it
benefit?"

"You
refer
to
the
army
contracts?"

"Yes.
It
means
to
the
person
securing
them
a
profit
of
over
one
hundred
thousand
dollars,
and
that
is
a
prize
valuable
enough
to
tempt
a
more
scrupulous
man
than
the
English
merchant."

"I
think
you
are
right.
If
Grant
has
been
waylaid,
or
spirited
away,
which
is
yet
to
be
proven,
we
have
something
to
work
on.
We
will
know
where
to
start
the
search."

Yokohama
was
reached
by
nightfall.
Mori
had
telegraphed
ahead,
and
they
found
Mr.
Burr,
a
tall,
grave
man
with
a
sandy
beard,
awaiting
them.
He
expressed
much
sympathy
for
Nattie's
condition,
and
then
led
the
way
to
the
_jinrikishas_.

"I
can
explain
matters
better
in
the
office,"
he
said,
in
answer
to
an
eager
question.
"'Tis
an
uncou'
night
eenyway,
and
we'll
do
better
under
shelter."

Compelled
to
restrain
their
impatience
perforce,
his
companions
sank
back
in
silence
and
watched
the
nimble
feet
of
the
_karumayas_
as
they
trotted
along
the
streets
on
the
way
to
the
Bund.

Turning
suddenly
into
the
broad,
well-lighted
main
street,
they
overtook
a
man
pacing
moodily
toward
the
bay.
As
they
dashed
past,
Nattie
glanced
at
him;
then,
with
an
imprecation,
the
lad
stood
up
in
his
vehicle.
A
twinge
of
pain
in
the
disabled
shoulder
sent
him
back
again.

Noting
the
action,
Mori
looked
behind
him,
and
just
in
time
to
see
the
man
slip
into
a
convenient
doorway.
It
was
Mr.
Black.

"Keep
cool,
Nattie,"
he
called
out.
"Confronting
him
without
proof
won't
help
us."

"But
did
you
see
how
he
acted
when
he
caught
sight
of
us?"

"Yes,
and
it
meant
guilt.
He
tried
to
dodge
out
of
our
sight."

On
reaching
the
office,
Mr.
Burr
led
the
way
inside.
Lighting
the
gas,
he
placed
chairs
for
his
companions,
and
seated
himself
at
his
desk.

"Noo
I
will
explain
everything,"
he
said,
gravely.
"But
first
tell
me
if
ye
anticipate
anything
serious?
Has
Mr.
Grant
absented
himself
before?"

"Never,"
Nattie
replied
to
the
last
question.

"Weel,
then,
the
situation
is
thus:
Last
night
he
left
here
at
the
usual
hour
and
took
a
_'rikisha_
in
front
of
the
door.
I
was
looking
through
the
window
at
the
time,
and
I
saw
him
disappear
around
the
corner
of
Main
Street.
I
opened
the
office
this
morning
at
eight
by
the
clock,
and
prepared
several
papers
and
checks
for
his
signature.
Time
passed
and
he
did
na'
show
oop.

"At
eleven
I
sent
a
messenger
to
the
house
on
the
'bluff.'
The
boy
returned
with
the
information
from
the
servants
that
Mr.
Grant
had
not
been
home.
Somewhat
alarmed,
I
sent
coolies
through
the
town
to
all
the
places
where
he
might
have
called,
but
without
results.
I
received
your
telegram
and
answered
it
at
once.
And
that's
all
I
know."

The
information
was
meager
enough.
Nattie
and
Mori
exchanged
glances
of
apprehension.
Their
worst
fears
were
realized.
That
some
disaster
had
happened
to
Grant
was
now
evident.
The
former
sprang
to
his
feet
and
started
toward
the
door
without
a
word.

"Where
are
you
going?"
asked
the
Japanese
youth,
hastily.

"To
see
Mr.
Black,"
was
the
determined
reply.
"The
villain
is
responsible
for
this."

"But
what
proof
can
you
present?
Don't
do
anything
rash,
Nattie.
We
must
talk
it
over
and
consider
the
best
plan
to
be
followed.
We
must
search
for
a
clew."

"And
in
the
meantime
they
will
kill
him.
Oh,
Mori,
I
can't
sit
here
and
parley
words
while
my
brother
is
in
danger.
I
know
Ralph
Black
and
his
father.
They
would
not
hesitate
at
anything
to
make
money.
Even
human
life
would
not
stop
them."

"That
may
be.
Still,
you
surely
can
see
that
we
must
go
slow
in
the
matter.
Believe
me,
Grant's
disappearance
affects
me
even
more
than
if
he
was
a
near
relative.
I
intend
to
enter
heart
and
soul
into
the
search
for
him.
Everything
I
possess,
my
fortune,
all,
is
at
his
disposal.
But
I
must
counsel
patience."

The
tears
welled
in
Nattie's
eyes.
He
tried
to
mutter
his
thanks,
but
his
emotion
was
too
great.
He
extended
his
hand,
and
it
was
grasped
by
the
young
native
with
fraternal
will.
The
Scot
had
been
eying
them
with
his
habitual
placidity.
The
opening
of
a
crater
under
the
office
floor
would
not
have
altered
his
calm
demeanor.

"Weel,
now,"
he
said,
slowly,
"can
you
no
explain
matters
to
me?
I
am
groping
about
in
the
dark."

"You
shall
be
told
everything,"
replied
Mori.

He
speedily
placed
him
in
possession
of
all
the
facts.
Mr.
Burr
listened
to
the
story
without
comment.
At
the
conclusion
he
said,
in
his
quiet
way:

"I
am
no
great
hand
at
detective
work,
but
I
can
see
as
far
thro'
a
millstone
as
any
mon
with
twa
gude
eyes.
Mister
Grant
has
been
kidnaped,
and
ye
don't
need
to
look
farther
than
the
Black's
for
a
clew."

"That
is
my
opinion
exactly,"
exclaimed
Nattie.

"I
am
with
you
both,"
said
Mori,
"but
I
still
insist
that
we
go
slow
in
accusing
them.
It
stands
to
reason
that
to
make
a
demand
now
would
warn
the
conspirators--for
such
they
are--that
we
suspect
them.
We
must
work
on
the
quiet."

"You
are
right,
sir,"
agreed
Mr.
Burr.

"What
is
your
plan?"
asked
Nattie,
with
natural
impatience.

"It
is
to
place
Mr.
Burr
in
charge
of
the
business
at
once,
and
for
us
to
start
forth
in
search
of
possible
clews.
I
will
try
to
put
a
man
in
the
Black
residence,
and
another
in
his
office.
We
must
hire
a
number
of
private
detectives--I
know
a
dozen--and
set
them
to
work
scouring
the
city.
The
station
master,
the
keeper
of
every
road,
the
railway
guards,
all
must
be
closely
questioned.
And
in
the
meantime,
while
I
am
posting
Mr.
Burr,
you
must
go
home
and
keep
as
quiet
as
you
can.
Remember,
excitement
will
produce
inflammation
in
that
shoulder,
and
inflammation
means
many
days
in
bed."

The
authoritative
tone
of
the
young
Japanese
had
its
effect.
Grumbling
at
his
enforced
idleness,
Nattie
left
the
office
and
proceeded
to
the
"bluff."
Mori
remained
at
the
counting-room,
and
carefully
drilled
the
Scotchman
in
the
business
on
hand.




CHAPTER
XX.

THE
MAN
BEYOND
THE
HEDGE.


It
was
past
midnight
when
he
finally
left
with
Mr.
Burr,
but
the
intervening
time
had
not
been
wasted.
Orders,
contracts
and
other
details
for
at
least
a
week
had
been
explained
to
the
bookkeeper,
and
he
was
given
full
powers
to
act
as
the
firm's
representative.
After
a
final
word
of
caution,
Mori
parted
with
him
at
the
door,
and
took
a
_'rikisha_
for
the
Manning
residence.
He
found
Nattie
pacing
the
floor
of
the
front
veranda.
The
lad
greeted
him
impatiently.

"Have
you
heard
anything?"
he
asked.

"Not
a
word.
I
have
been
busy
at
the
office
since
you
left.
Everything
is
arranged.
Mr.
Burr
has
taken
charge,
and
he
will
conduct
the
business
until
this
thing
is
settled.
We
are
lucky
to
have
such
a
man
in
our
employ."

"Yes,
yes;
Burr
is
an
honest
fellow.
But
what
do
you
intend
to
do
now?"

"Still
excited,
I
see,"
smiled
Mori.
He
shook
a
warning
finger
at
the
lad,
and
added,
seriously:
"Remember
what
I
told
you.
If
you
continue
in
this
fashion
I
will
call
a
doctor
and
have
you
taken
to
the
hospital."

"I
can't
help
it,"
replied
Nattie,
piteously.
"I
just
can't
keep
still
while
Grant
is
in
danger.
You
don't
know
how
anxious
I
am.
Let
me
do
something
to
keep
my
mind
occupied."

"If
you
promise
to
go
to
bed
for
the
rest
of
the
night
I
will
give
you
ten
minutes
now
to
discuss
our
plans.
Do
you
agree?"

"Yes;
but
you
intend
to
remain
here
until
morning?"

"No,
I
cannot
spare
the
time.
I
must
have
the
detectives
searching
for
clews
before
daylight."

"Mori,
you
are
a
friend
indeed.
Some
day
I
will
show
you
how
much
I
appreciate
your
kindness."

"Nonsense!
You
would
do
as
much
if
not
more
if
the
case
was
reversed.
Now
for
the
plans.
To
commence,
we
are
absolutely
certain
of
one
thing:
Patrick
Cronin
was
in
the
scheme,
and
he
was
sent
to
get
us
out
of
the
way
while
Ralph
and
Willis
Round
attended
to
Grant."

"I
am
glad
the
Irishman
met
with
his
just
deserts,"
exclaimed
Nattie,
vindictively.
"He
is
now
food
for
fishes."

"Yes;
a
fitting
fate.
The
accident
cannot
be
considered
an
unmixed
catastrophe.
If
it
had
not
occurred
we
would
have
gone
on
to
Nagasaki,
and
have
lost
much
valuable
time.
As
it
is,
we
are
comparatively
early.
What
we
need
now
is
a
clew,
and
for
that
I
intend
to
begin
a
search
at
once."

"Would
it
do
any
good
to
notify
the
American
Consul?"

"No;
our
best
plan
is
to
keep
the
affair
as
quiet
as
possible.
We
will
say
nothing
about
it.
If
Grant
is
missed
we
can
intimate
that
he
has
gone
away
for
a
week.

"Now
go
to
bed
and
sleep
if
you
can,"
he
added,
preparing
to
leave.
"I
will
call
shortly
after
breakfast
and
report
progress."

With
a
friendly
nod
of
his
head
he
departed
on
his
quest
for
detectives.
Nattie
remained
seated
for
a
brief
period,
then
he
walked
over
to
a
bell-pull,
and
summoned
a
servant.
At
his
command
the
man
brought
him
a
heavy
cloak,
and
assisted
him
to
don
his
shoes.

From
a
chest
of
drawers
in
an
adjacent
room
the
lad
took
a
revolver.
After
carefully
examining
the
charges
he
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
and
left
the
house.

The
night
was
hot
and
sultry.
Not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred,
and
the
mellow
rays
of
a
full
moon
beamed
down
on
ground
and
foliage,
which
seemed
to
glow
with
the
tropical
heat.
Notwithstanding
the
discomfort
Nattie
drew
his
cloak
about
him
and
set
out
at
a
rapid
walk
down
the
street
leading
past
the
Manning
residence.

From
out
on
the
bay
came
the
distant
rattle
of
a
steamer's
winch.
The
stillness
was
so
oppressive
that
even
the
shrill
notes
of
a
boatswain's
whistle
came
to
his
ears.
An
owl
hooted
in
a
nearby
maple;
the
melancholy
howl
of
a
strolling
dog
sounded
from
below
where
the
native
town
was
stretched
out
in
irregular
rows
of
bamboo
houses.

The
lad
kept
to
the
shady
side
of
the
road,
and
continued
without
stopping
until
he
reached
a
mansion
built
in
the
English
style,
some
ten
or
eleven
blocks
from
his
house.
The
building
stood
in
the
center
of
extensive
grounds,
and
was
separated
from
the
street
by
an
ornamental
iron
fence
and
a
well-cultivated
hedge.

It
was
evidently
the
home
of
a
man
of
wealth.
In
fact,
it
was
the
domicile
of
Mr.
Black
and
his
son
Ralph.
What
was
Nattie's
object
in
leaving
the
Manning
residence
in
face
of
Mori's
warning?
What
was
his
object
in
paying
a
visit
to
his
enemy
at
such
an
hour
of
the
night?

Anxious,
almost
beside
himself
with
worry,
suffering
severely
from
his
dislocated
shoulder,
and
perhaps
slightly
under
the
influence
of
a
fever,
the
lad
had
yielded
to
his
first
impulse
when
alone,
and
set
out
from
home
with
no
settled
purpose.

On
reaching
the
open
air
he
thought
of
Jesse
Black.
The
mansion
was
only
a
short
distance
away;
perhaps
something
could
be
learned
by
watching
it.
The
conjecture
was
father
to
the
deed.

Selecting
a
spot
shaded
by
a
thick-foliaged
tree,
Nattie
carefully
scanned
the
_façade_
of
the
building.
It
was
of
two
stories,
and
prominent
bow-windows
jutted
out
from
each
floor.
The
lower
part
was
dark,
but
a
dim
light
shone
through
the
curtains
of
the
last
window
on
the
right.

A
bell
down
in
the
Bund
struck
twice;
it
was
two
o'clock.
At
the
sound
a
dark
figure
appeared
at
the
window
and
thrust
the
shade
aside.
The
distance
was
not
too
great
for
Nattie
to
distinguish
the
man
as
the
English
merchant.

Drawing
himself
up
the
lad
shook
his
fist
at
the
apparition.
The
action
brought
his
head
above
the
hedge.
Something
moving
on
the
other
side
caught
his
eye,
and
he
dodged
back
just
as
a
man
arose
to
his
feet
within
easy
touch.

Breathless
with
amazement,
Nattie
crouched
down,
and
parting
the
roots
of
the
hedge,
peered
through.
The
fellow
was
cautiously
moving
toward
the
house.
Something
in
his
walk
seemed
familiar.
Presently
he
reached
a
spot
where
the
moon's
bright
rays
fell
upon
him.

A
stifled
cry
of
profound
astonishment,
not
unmingled
with
terror,
came
from
the
lad's
lips,
and
he
shrank
back
as
if
with
the
intention
of
fleeing.
He
thought
better
of
it,
however,
and
watched
with
eager
eyes.
A
dozen
times
the
man
in
the
grounds
halted
and
crouched
to
the
earth,
but
finally
he
reached
the
front
entrance
of
the
mansion.

A
door
was
opened,
and
a
hand
was
thrust
forth
with
beckoning
fingers.
The
fellow
hastily
stepped
inside
and
vanished
from
view,
leaving
Nattie
a-quiver
with
excitement.
The
dislocated
shoulder,
the
pain,
the
fever,
all
were
forgotten
in
the
importance
of
the
discovery.

"That
settles
it,"
he
muttered.
"I
am
on
the
right
track
as
sure
as
the
moon
is
shining.
Now
I
must
enter
that
house
by
hook
or
crook.
But
who
would
believe
that
miracles
could
happen
in
this
century?
If
that
fellow
wasn't----"

He
abruptly
ceased
speaking.
The
door
in
the
front
entrance
suddenly
opened,
and
a
huge
dog
was
thrust
down
the
stone
steps.
Nattie
knew
the
animal
well.
It
was
a
ferocious
brute
Ralph
had
imported
from
England
that
year.

As
a
watchdog
it
bore
a
well-merited
reputation
among
the
natives
of
thieving
propensities.
It
was
dreaded
because
it
thought
more
of
a
direct
application
of
sharp
teeth
than
any
amount
of
barking.
Its
unexpected
appearance
on
the
scene
altered
matters
considerably.

"Dog
or
no
dog,
I
intend
to
find
my
way
into
that
house
before
many
minutes,"
decided
the
lad.
"It
is
an
opportunity
I
cannot
permit
to
pass."

He
drew
out
his
revolver,
but
shook
his
head
and
restored
it
again
to
his
pocket.
A
shot
would
alarm
the
neighborhood
and
bring
a
squad
of
police
upon
the
scene.
The
brute
must
be
silenced
in
some
other
manner.

Naturally
apt
and
resourceful,
it
was
not
long
before
Nattie
thought
of
a
plan.
Cautiously
edging
away
from
the
hedge
until
he
had
reached
a
safe
distance,
he
set
out
at
a
run
toward
home.
Fortunately,
the
street
was
free
from
police
or
pedestrians,
and
he
finally
gained
the
Manning
residence
without
being
observed.

Slipping
into
the
garden
he
whistled
softly.
A
big-jointed,
lanky
pup
slouched
up
to
him
and
fawned
about
his
feet.
Picking
up
the
dog,
he
started
back
with
it
under
his
right
arm.
The
return
to
the
English
merchant's
house
was
made
without
mishap.

Reaching
the
hedge,
Nattie
lightly
tossed
the
pup
over
into
the
yard.
It
struck
the
ground
with
a
yelp,
and
a
second
later
a
dark
shadow
streaked
across
the
lawn
from
the
mansion.
As
the
lad
had
anticipated,
the
dog
he
had
brought
did
not
wait
to
be
attacked,
but
started
along
the
inner
side
of
the
hedge
with
fear-given
speed.
In
less
than
a
moment
pursuer
and
pursued
disappeared
behind
an
outlying
stable.

Chuckling
at
the
success
of
his
scheme,
Nattie
softly
climbed
the
fence
and
leaped
into
the
yard.
The
lawn
was
bright
with
the
rays
of
the
moon,
but
he
walked
across
it
without
hesitation,
finally
reaching
the
house
near
the
left-hand
corner.

As
he
expected,
he
found
a
side
door
unguarded
save
by
a
wire
screen.
A
swift
slash
with
a
strong
pocket-knife
gave
an
aperture
through
which
the
lad
forced
his
hand.
To
unfasten
the
latch
was
the
work
of
a
second,
and
a
brief
space
later
he
stood
in
a
narrow
hall
leading
to
the
main
corridor.




CHAPTER
XXI.

A
PRISONER.


On
reaching
the
main
stairway
he
heard
voices
overhead.
The
sound
seemed
to
come
from
a
room
opening
into
the
hall
above.
Quickly
removing
his
shoes,
the
lad
tied
the
strings
together,
and
throwing
them
about
his
neck,
he
ascended
to
the
upper
floor.

Fortunately,
Nattie
had
visited
the
Black
mansion
in
his
earlier
days
when
he
and
Ralph
were
on
terms
of
comparative
intimacy.
He
knew
the
general
plan
of
the
house,
and
the
knowledge
stood
him
in
good
stead
now.

The
room
from
which
the
sound
of
voices
came
was
a
study
used
by
the
English
merchant
himself.
Next
to
it
was
a
spare
apartment
filled
with
odd
pieces
of
furniture
and
what-not.
In
former
days
it
was
a
guest
chamber,
and
the
lad
had
occupied
it
one
night
while
on
a
visit
to
the
merchant's
son.

He
remembered
that
a
door,
surmounted
by
a
glass
transom,
led
from
the
study
to
the
spare
room,
and
that
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
see
into
the
former
by
that
means.

He
tried
the
knob,
and
found
that
it
turned
at
his
touch.
A
slight
rattle
underneath
proclaimed
that
a
bunch
of
keys
was
swinging
from
the
lock.
Closing
the
door
behind
him,
he
tiptoed
across
the
apartment,
carefully
avoiding
the
various
articles
of
furniture.

To
his
great
disappointment,
he
found
that
heavy
folds
of
cloth
had
been
stretched
across
the
transom,
completely
obstructing
the
view.
To
make
it
worse,
the
voices
were
so
faint
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
distinguish
more
than
an
occasional
word.

"Confound
it!
I
have
my
labor
for
my
pains!"
he
muttered.
"It's
a
risky
thing,
but
I'll
have
to
try
the
other
door."

He
had
barely
reached
the
hall
when
the
talking
in
the
next
room
became
louder,
then
he
heard
a
rattling
of
the
knob.
The
occupants
were
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
study.
To
dart
into
the
spare
room
was
Nattie's
first
action.
Dropping
behind
a
large
dressing-case,
he
listened
intently.

"Well,
I
am
thoroughly
satisfied
with
your
part
of
the
affair
so
far,"
came
to
his
eager
ears
in
the
English
merchant's
well-known
voice.
"It
was
well
planned
in
every
respect.
You
had
a
narrow
escape
though."

A
deep
chuckle
came
from
the
speaker's
companion.

"No
suspicion
attaches
to
me,"
continued
Mr.
Black.
"I
met
the
boys
last
night,
but
I
don't
think
they
saw
me."

"Oh,
didn't
we?"
murmured
Nattie.

"You
can
go
now.
Give
this
letter
of
instructions
to
my
son,
and
tell
him
to
make
all
haste
to
the
place
mentioned.
Return
here
with
his
answer
as
quickly
as
you
can.
In
this
purse
you
will
find
ample
funds
to
meet
all
legitimate
expenses.
Legitimate
expenses,
you
understand?
If
you
fall
by
the
wayside
in
the
manner
I
mentioned
before
you
will
not
get
a
_sen_
of
the
amount
I
promised
you.
Now--confound
those
rascally
servants
of
mine!
they
have
left
this
room
unlocked!
I
must
discharge
the
whole
lot
of
them
and
get
others."

Click!
went
the
key
in
the
door
behind
which
Nattie
crouched.
He
was
a
prisoner!

The
sound
of
footsteps
came
faintly
to
him;
he
heard
the
front
entrance
open;
then
it
closed
again,
and
all
was
silent
in
the
house.
After
waiting
a
reasonable
time
he
tried
the
knob,
but
it
resisted
his
efforts.
Placing
his
right
shoulder
against
the
wood
he
attempted
to
force
the
panel,
but
without
avail.

"Whew!
this
is
being
caught
in
a
trap
certainly!
A
pretty
fix
I
am
in
now.
And
it
is
just
the
time
to
track
that
scoundrel.
Mr.
Black
must
have
been
talking
about
poor
Grant."

Rendered
almost
frantic
by
his
position,
Nattie
threw
himself
against
the
door
with
all
his
power.
The
only
result
was
a
deadly
pain
in
the
injured
shoulder.
Almost
ready
to
cry
with
chagrin
and
anguish,
he
sat
down
upon
a
chair
and
gave
himself
up
to
bitter
reflections.

Minutes
passed,
a
clock
in
the
study
struck
three;
but
still
he
sat
there
a
prey
to
conflicting
emotions.
He
now
saw
that
he
had
acted
foolishly.
What
had
he
learned?
They
had
suspected
the
Blacks
before,
and
confirmation
was
not
needed.

The
discovery
of
the
visitor's
identity
was
something,
but
its
importance
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
disaster
which
had
befallen
Nattie.
The
recent
conversation
in
the
hall
indicated
that
the
merchant's
companion
would
leave
at
once
for
a
rendezvous
to
meet
Ralph,
and
possibly
Grant.

"And
here
I
am,
fastened
in
like
a
disobedient
child,"
groaned
the
lad.
"I
must
escape
before
daylight.
If
I
am
caught
in
here
Mr.
Black
can
have
me
arrested
on
a
charge
of
attempted
burglary.
It
would
be
just
nuts
to
him."

The
fear
of
delay,
engendered
by
this
new
apprehension,
spurred
him
to
renewed
activity.
He
again
examined
the
door,
but
speedily
gave
up
the
attempt.
Either
a
locksmith's
tools
or
a
heavy
battering-ram
would
be
necessary
to
force
it.

Creeping
to
the
one
window
opening
from
the
apartment,
Nattie
found
that
he
could
raise
it
without
much
trouble.
The
generous
rays
of
the
moon
afforded
ample
light.
By
its
aid
he
saw
that
a
dense
mass
of
creeping
vines
almost
covered
that
side
of
the
mansion.

"By
George!
a
chance
at
last!"

Cautiously
crawling
through
the
opening
he
clutched
a
thick
stem
and
tried
to
swing
downward
with
his
right
hand.
As
he
made
the
effort
a
pain
shot
through
his
injured
shoulder
so
intense
that
he
almost
fainted.
He
repressed
a
cry
with
difficulty.

Weak
and
trembling,
he
managed
to
regain
the
window
sill.
Once
in
the
room
he
sank
down
upon
the
floor
and
battled
with
the
greatest
anguish
it
had
ever
been
his
lot
to
feel.

To
add
to
his
suffering,
came
the
conviction
that
he
would
be
unable
to
escape.
He
remembered
the
telltale
slit
he
had
made
in
the
screen
door.
When
daylight
arrived
it
would
be
discovered
by
the
servants,
and
a
search
instituted
throughout
the
house.

"Well,
it
can't
be
helped,"
mused
the
lad.
"If
I
am
caught,
I'm
caught,
and
that's
all
there
is
about
it."

It
is
a
difficult
thing
to
philosophize
when
suffering
with
an
intense
physical
pain
and
in
the
throes
of
a
growing
fever.
It
was
not
long
before
Nattie
fell
into
a
stupor.

He
finally
became
conscious
of
an
increasing
light
in
the
room,
and
roused
himself
enough
to
glance
from
the
window.
Far
in
the
distance
loomed
the
mighty
volcano
of
Fuji
San,
appearing
under
the
marvelous
touch
of
the
morning
sun
like
an
inverted
cone
of
many
jewels.

A
hum
of
voices
sounded
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house,
but
no
one
came
to
disturb
him.
Rendered
drowsy
by
fever,
he
fell
into
a
deep
slumber,
and
when
he
awoke
it
was
to
hear
the
study
clock
strike
nine.
He
had
slept
fully
five
hours.

Considerably
refreshed,
Nattie
started
up
to
again
search
for
a
way
to
effect
his
escape.
The
pain
had
left
his
shoulder,
but
he
felt
an
overpowering
thirst.
His
mind
was
clear,
however,
and
that
was
half
the
battle.

"If
I
had
more
strength
in
my
left
arm
I
would
try
those
vines
once
more,"
he
said
to
himself.
"Things
can't
last
this
way
forever.
I
must--what's
that?"

Footsteps
sounded
in
the
hall
outside.
They
drew
nearer,
and
at
last
stopped
in
front
of
the
spare-room
door.
A
hand
was
laid
upon
the
knob,
and
keys
rattled.

"We
have
searched
every
room
but
this,"
came
in
the
smooth
tones
of
the
English
merchant.
"Go
inside,
my
man,
and
see
if
a
burglar
is
hiding
among
the
furniture.
Here,
take
this
revolver;
and
don't
fear
to
use
it
if
necessary."

Like
a
hunted
animal
at
bay,
the
lad
glared
about
him.
Discovery
seemed
certain.
Over
in
one
corner
he
espied
a
chest
of
drawers.
It
afforded
poor
concealment,
but
it
was
the
best
at
hand.
To
drag
it
away
from
the
wall
was
the
work
of
a
second.
When
the
door
was
finally
opened,
Nattie
was
crouched
behind
the
piece
of
furniture.

He
heard
the
soft
steps
of
a
pair
of
sandals;
he
heard
chairs
and
various
articles
moved
about,
then
the
searcher
approached
his
corner.
Desperate
and
ready
to
fight
for
his
liberty,
he
glanced
up--and
uttered
a
half-stifled
cry
of
amazement
and
joy!




CHAPTER
XXII.

THE
PURSUIT.


It
is
always
the
unexpected
that
happens.
When
Nattie
glanced
up
from
his
place
of
refuge
behind
the
chest
of
drawers,
he
saw
a
young
man
clad
as
a
native
servant
looking
down
at
him.
There
was
the
gayly
colored
cloth
tied
around
the
head;
the
_kimono_,
or
outer
garment
cut
away
at
the
neck,
and
the
plain
silk
kerchief
tied
with
a
bow
under
the
ear.

But
the
face
was
not
that
of
a
native
_waallo_,
or
houseman;
it
was
Mori
Okuma
himself,
the
very
last
person
on
earth
Nattie
expected
to
find
in
the
spare
room
of
the
Black
mansion.

The
young
Japanese
started
back
in
profound
surprise,
his
eyes
widened,
and
he
nearly
called
out;
but
a
warning
motion
from
the
concealed
lad--who
recovered
his
coolness
with
marvelous
rapidity--checked
him.

"It
is
I;
Nattie!"
came
to
his
ears.
"Take
old
Black
away
and
return
as
soon
as
possible.
I
have
a
clew;
we
must
leave
here
immediately."

Regaining
his
composure
with
an
effort,
Mori
continued
his
search
among
the
other
articles
of
furniture.

"No
one
here,
excellency,"
he
said,
at
last.

"Then
the
scoundrel
who
cut
that
screen
door
has
decamped,"
replied
Mr.
Black,
who
had
remained
near
the
door
with
commendable
precaution.
"Go
down
to
the
pantry
and
help
the
rest
count
the
silver.
By
the
way,
what
is
your
name?"

"Kai
Jin,
excellency."

"Well,
Kai,
see
that
you
behave
yourself
and
you
can
remain
in
my
service.
But
if
you
are
lazy
or
thievish,
out
you
go."

His
voice
died
away
in
muffled
grumbling
down
the
hall.
Finally
left
to
himself,
Nattie
emerged
from
his
hiding
place
and
executed
several
figures
of
a
jig
in
the
middle
of
the
floor.

"Wonders
will
never
cease,"
he
muttered,
with
a
chuckle
of
joy.
"Fancy
finding
Mori
here,
and
just
in
the
nick
of
time.
He's
a
great
lad.
He
disguised
himself
and
took
service
in
the
house.
He
would
make
a
good
detective."

He
was
still
pondering
over
the
queer
discovery
when
a
noise
at
the
door
indicated
that
some
one
was
on
the
point
of
entering.
A
warning
whisper
proclaimed
that
it
was
Mori.

The
Japanese
youth
entered
quickly
and
closed
the
heavy
oaken
portal
behind
him.
He
was
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter.
Running
over
to
Nattie,
he
grasped
his
hand
and
wrung
it
heartily.

"I
ought
to
scold
you
for
disobeying
my
orders,
but
really
this
is
too
funny
for
anything,"
he
said.
"How
under
the
sun
did
you
get
in
here?"

"Easy
enough;
I
walked
in
last
night.
How
did
you
get
in?"

"I
am
a
member
of
his
excellency's
staff
of
servants.
Ha,
ha!
I
almost
laughed
in
his
lean
old
face
this
morning
when
he
engaged
me.
But
explain
yourself,
Nattie;
I
am
dying
to
hear
your
news.
You
said
you
had
a
clew."

"Hadn't
we
better
get
out
of
this
house
before
we
talk?"

"Plenty
of
time.
Mr.
Black
has
gone
to
the
office,
and
the
servants
are
below
stairs.
When
we
are
ready
we
can
walk
out
through
the
front
entrance
without
a
word
to
anybody."

Thus
reassured,
Nattie
told
how
he
had
left
home
the
preceding
night
and
the
events
that
followed.
When
he
came
to
the
part
relating
to
the
man
beyond
the
hedge,
the
English
merchant's
midnight
visitor,
Mori
started
at
him
in
amazement.

"Impossible!"
he
exclaimed.
"Why,
he
was
killed
in
the
accident
near
Kobe."

"Not
so.
I
saw
the
fellow's
face
almost
as
clearly
as
I
see
yours
now.
It
was
Patrick
Cronin,
and
I'll
stake
my
life
on
that."

"Then
the
scoundrel
escaped
after
all?"

"Yes;
to
receive
his
just
dues
at
the
hangman's
hands,
I
suppose.
But
I
haven't
told
you
of
my
clew.
I
overheard
Black
and
Patrick
talking
out
in
the
hall
there.
It
seems
that
Cronin
has
a
letter
which
he
is
to
deliver
without
delay
to
Ralph
at
some
rendezvous.
That
it
relates
to
Grant
is
certain.
By
following
the
Irishman
we
can
find
my
brother."

"It
will
be
easy
enough,"
replied
Mori,
his
eyes
expressing
his
delight.
"The
fellow
won't
try
to
hide
his
steps,
as
it
were.
He
considers
the
accident
a
good
veil
to
his
existence.
Nattie,
it
was
a
lucky
inspiration,
your
coming
here
last
night."

"Then
I
am
forgiven
for
disobeying
orders,
eh?"
smiled
the
lad.

"In
this
case,
yes,
but
don't
do
it
again.
How
is
your
shoulder?"

"First-chop,
barring
a
little
soreness.
It
will
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
two.
Come,
let's
leave
here
before
we
are
discovered."

The
exit
from
the
building
and
grounds
was
made
without
mishap.
The
lads
hastily
returned
to
the
Manning
residence,
where
Nattie
ordered
breakfast
served
at
once.
On
entering
the
garden,
the
lanky
pup
used
by
him
as
a
decoy
to
Ralph's
watchdog
came
bounding
from
the
rear.
He
had
evidently
escaped
without
feeling
the
teeth
of
the
larger
animal.

The
meal
was
dispatched
in
haste,
then
'rikishas
were
taken
to
the
Bund.
While
Nattie
waited
in
the
firm's
office,
Mori
utilized
the
central
police
station
in
tracing
Patrick
Cronin.
In
less
than
an
hour
word
came
that
a
man
answering
his
description
had
been
seen
leaving
the
city
on
horseback
by
way
of
the
road
leading
to
Tokio.

"That
settles
it!"
exclaimed
the
Japanese
youth.
"We
must
take
the
train
for
the
capital
at
once.
That
is,"
he
added,
anxiously,
"if
you
think
you
are
able
to
travel."

"I
am
fit
for
anything,"
promptly
replied
Nattie.
"Come,
we
must
not
lose
a
moment."

On
their
way
to
the
station
they
stopped
at
the
telegraph
office
and
wired
the
chief
of
police
of
Tokio
a
full
description
of
Patrick.
After
a
consultation,
they
added:







"Do
not
arrest
the
man,
but
have
your
best
detective
shadow
him





wherever
he
may
go.
All
expenses
will
be
met
by
us."


"To
capture
him
now
would
destroy
our
only
clew,"
said
Nattie.
"He
might
confess
to
save
himself,
and
then,
again,
he
might
not.
If
he
should
remain
silent
we
would
have
no
means
of
finding
Grant's
whereabouts."

The
nineteen
miles
to
Japan's
populous
capital
were
covered
in
short
order.
Brief
as
was
the
time,
the
lads
were
met
at
the
depot
by
an
officer
in
civilian's
clothes,
who
reported
that
their
man
had
been
seen
to
take
a
train
at
Ueno,
a
small
suburb
on
the
outskirts
of
Tokio.

"We
are
doing
excellently,"
chuckled
Mori.
"The
fool
thinks
he
is
safe
and
he
travels
openly.
At
this
rate
the
chase
will
be
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log,
to
use
an
Americanism."

"He
has
five
hours'
start.
We
must
telegraph
ahead
to
the
conductor
of
his
train."

"And
to
every
station."

"That
has
been
done,
sir,"
spoke
up
the
police
official.
"The
last
word
received
stated
that
he
was
still
on
board
when
the
train
passed
Motomiya."

"When
can
we
leave?"

The
man
consulted
a
time-table
patterned
after
those
used
in
the
United
States,
and
announced
that
an
express
would
depart
within
twenty
minutes.
Hurrying
to
a
neighboring
hotel,
the
lads
ate
"tiffin,"
and
returned
in
time
to
embark
upon
the
second
stage
of
the
chase.

When
the
train
steamed
into
a
way
station
three
hours
later
a
railway
employee
in
gorgeous
uniform
approached
them
with
a
telegram.
Hastily
opening
the
envelope,
Nattie
read,
with
keen
disappointment:







"HEADQUARTERS,
Tokio.






"Our
detective
reports
that
the
man
he
had
been
following
managed





to
evade
him
at
Yowara,
and
has
completely
disappeared.
Local





police
are
searching
the
mountains."




CHAPTER
XXIII.

PATRICK
SHOWS
HIS
CLEVERNESS.


Nattie
and
Mori
exchanged
glances
of
dismay.

"Confound
it!
isn't
that
provoking?"
exclaimed
the
latter.
"That
stupid
detective
had
to
let
him
slip
just
when
the
chase
commenced
to
be
interesting."

"Patrick
must
have
suspected
something,
and
he
was
sly
enough
to
fool
his
follower.
Now
what
are
we
going
to
do?"

"Get
off
at
Yowara
and
take
up
the
search
ourselves;
that's
all
we
can
do.
Surely
some
one
must
have
seen
the
Irishman.
The
very
fact
that
he
is
a
foreigner
should
draw
attention
to
him.
Don't
worry,
old
boy;
we'll
find
him
before
many
hours
have
elapsed."

"I
sincerely
hope
so,"
replied
Nattie,
gazing
abstractedly
through
the
coach
window.

After
a
moment
of
silence
he
said,
suddenly:

"Perhaps
Yowara
is
the
rendezvous
where
he
is
to
meet
Ralph.
Do
you
know
anything
about
the
place?"

"No,
except
that
it
is
a
small
town
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
inhabitants.
It
is
where
people
leave
the
railway
for
the
mountain
regions
of
Northern
Japan.
In
a
remote
part
of
the
interior
are
three
volcanoes,
one
of
them
being
Bandai-San,
which
is
famous
for
its
eruptions."

"Bandai-San?"
slowly
repeated
Nattie.
"Isn't
it
at
the
base
of
that
volcano
where
those
peculiar
mud
caves
are
found?"

Mori
eyed
his
companion
inquiringly.

"What
are
you
driving
at?"
he
asked.

"Just
this:
It
struck
me
that
Ralph
and
Willis
Round
would
certainly
try
to
find
a
hiding
place
for
Grant
where
they
need
not
fear
pursuit,
or
inquisitiveness
from
the
natives.
I
have
heard
that
these
caves
are
avoided
through
superstitious
reasons.
Now
why----"

"By
the
heathen
gods,
I
believe
you
have
guessed
their
secret!"
impulsively
exclaimed
Mori.
"It
is
certainly
plausible.
A
better
hiding
place
could
not
be
found
in
all
Japan.
The
natives
will
not
enter
the
caves
under
any
consideration.
They
say
they
are
occupied
by
the
mountain
demons,
and
to
prove
it,
tell
of
the
awful
noises
to
be
heard
in
the
vicinity."

"Which
are
caused
by
internal
convulsions
of
the
volcano,
I
suppose?"

"No
doubt.
The
mountain
is
generally
on
the
verge
of
being
shaken
by
earthquakes,
but
it
is
some
time
since
one
occurred.
It's
a
grewsome
place
enough."

"We
will
search
it
thoroughly
just
the
same,"
said
Nattie,
grimly.

On
reaching
Yowara,
they
found
the
recreant
detective
at
the
station.
He
had
recently
returned
from
a
trip
through
the
surrounding
country,
but
had
not
discovered
any
trace
of
the
Irishman.
He
appeared
crestfallen
and
penitent.

The
boys
wasted
little
time
with
him.
Proceeding
to
the
village
hotel,
or
tea
house,
they
sent
out
messengers
for
three
_jinrikishas_
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
were
ready
to
start
into
the
interior.

The
spare
vehicle
was
loaded
with
canned
food
and
other
stores,
as
the
railroad
town
would
be
the
last
place
where
such
articles
could
be
purchased.
Each
had
brought
a
brace
of
good
revolvers
and
plenty
of
ammunition
from
Yokohama.

Mori
personally
selected
the
_karumayas_,
or
_'rikisha_
men,
from
a
crowd
of
applicants.
He
chose
three
stalwart
coolies
to
pull
the
carriages,
and
three
_bettos_,
or
porters,
to
assist
on
mountainous
roads.
One
of
the
latter
was
a
veritable
giant
in
stature
and
evidently
of
great
strength.

He
was
called
Sumo,
or
wrestler,
by
his
companions,
and
seemed
to
possess
greater
intelligence
than
the
average
members
of
his
class.
Mori
eyed
him
approvingly,
and
told
Nattie
that
he
would
be
of
undoubted
assistance
in
case
of
trouble.

Before
leaving
the
village,
the
Japanese
youth
bought
a
keen-edged
sword,
similar
to
those
worn
by
the
ancient
warriors,
or
_samurais_,
and
presented
it
to
Sumo,
with
the
added
stipulation
that
he
would
be
retained
as
a
guard
at
increased
pay.

The
fellow
shouted
with
delight,
and
speedily
showed
that
he
could
handle
the
weapon
with
some
skill.
Thus
equipped,
the
party
left
the
railroad
and
set
out
for
a
village
called
Inawashiro,
fifteen
_ris_,
or
thirty
miles
distant.

In
Japan
the
coolie
rule
is
twenty
minutes'
rest
every
two
hours.
Their
method
of
traveling
is
at
a
"dog
trot,"
or
long,
swinging
pace,
which
covers
the
ground
with
incredible
swiftness.
Mori's
skill
in
selecting
the
_karumayas_
soon
became
apparent,
the
distance
to
the
destination
being
almost
halved
at
the
end
of
the
first
stretch.

The
country
through
which
the
boys
passed
was
flat
and
uninteresting,
the
narrow
road
stretching
across
a
broad
expanse
of
paddy
fields,
dotted
with
men,
women
and
children
knee-deep
in
the
evil-smelling
mud.

When
a
halt
was
called
to
rest
and
partake
of
refreshments,
Mori
accosted
a
native
coolie,
a
number
of
whom
surrounded
the
party,
and
asked
if
aught
had
been
seen
of
a
fiery-faced,
red-whiskered
foreigner
clad
in
the
heavy
clothing
of
the
coast.

The
man
eyed
his
questioner
stupidly,
and
shook
his
head.
The
sight
of
a
couple
of
copper
_sen_,
or
cents,
refreshed
his
memory.
He
had
noticed
a
short,
squat
foreigner
(called
_to-jin_)
in
the
interior.
He
was
mounted
upon
a
horse
and
had
passed
four
hours
before.

"Four
hours?"
echoed
Mori,
addressing
Nattie.
"Whew!
he
has
a
good
start.
And
on
a
horse,
too.
That
is
the
reason
we
could
get
no
trace
of
him
in
the
outskirts
of
Yowara.
He
must
have
left
the
train
before
it
stopped
and
skipped
into
the
brush,
where
he
managed
to
secure
a
mount.
He
is
certainly
clever."

"But
not
enough
to
fool
us,"
replied
Nattie,
complacently.
"We
will
be
hot
on
his
trail
before
he
reaches
the
caves."

After
the
customary
rest
of
twenty
minutes,
the
party
resumed
the
road.
As
they
proceeded
the
general
contour
of
the
country
changed.
The
flat,
plain-like
fields
gave
way
to
rolling
woodlands
and
scattered
hills.
The
second
hour
brought
them
to
the
small
village
of
Inawashiro.

Here
was
found
a
well-kept
tea
house,
with
spotless
matted
floor,
two
feet
above
the
ground,
a
quaint
roof,
and
the
attendance
of
a
dozen
polite
servants.
Before
the
party
had
barely
reached
their
resting
place,
the
entire
inhabitants,
men,
women
and
children,
thronged
about
to
feast
their
eyes
upon
a
_to-jin_.

Inquiry
developed
the
fact
that
Patrick
had
passed
through
the
town
not
quite
two
hours
before.
This
was
cheering
news.
They
were
gaining
on
him.
A
brief
lunch,
and
again
to
the
road.
Nattie
and
Mori
examined
their
revolvers
after
leaving
the
village.
Sumo
cut
a
sapling
in
twain
to
prove
his
prowess.

At
the
end
of
the
fourth
mile
a
crossroad
was
reached.
One,
a
broad,
well-kept
thoroughfare,
led
due
north,
while
the
other,
apparently
merely
a
path
running
over
a
hill
in
the
distance,
bore
more
to
the
westward.
Mori
called
a
halt.

"Which
shall
we
take?"
he
asked,
scratching
his
head
in
perplexity.

"That
is
the
question,"
replied
Nattie,
ruefully.
"Confound
it!
we
are
just
as
apt
to
take
the
wrong
one
as
not.
If
we
could
run
across
some
person
who
has
seen
Patrick
we
would
be
all
right."

"Here
comes
a
_yamabushi_,
excellency,"
spoke
up
Sumo,
pointing
his
claw-like
finger
up
the
path.

"It
is
a
priest,"
exclaimed
Mori,
a
moment
later.
"Perhaps
he
can
enlighten
us."

Presently
a
tall,
angular
man
emerged
from
the
narrower
road
and
slowly
approached
them.
He
was
clad
in
a
peculiar
robe
embroidered
with
mystical
figures,
and
wore
his
hair
in
long
plaits.
In
one
hand
was
carried
a
bamboo
staff,
with
which
he
tapped
the
ground
as
he
walked.

Mori
saluted
him
respectfully.

"Peace
be
with
you,
my
children,"
said
the
priest,
mildly.

"May
your
days
be
long
in
good
works,
and
your
soul
as
lofty
as
Fuji
San,"
replied
the
Japanese
youth,
with
equal
politeness.
"Pray
tell
us,
father,
have
you
seen
aught
of
a
red-bearded
foreigner
traveling
by
horse?"

"I
passed
him
two
_ris_
back.
He
was
a
barbarian,
and
beat
his
animal
with
severity.
Which
is
against
the
teachings
of----"

The
good
man's
words
were
lost
in
the
distance.
Nattie
and
Mori,
with
their
_'rikishas_
and
attendants,
darted
past
him
and
scurried
up
the
path
at
their
utmost
speed.
It
was
scurvy
repayment
for
the
information,
but
the
news
that
Patrick
had
been
seen
within
four
miles
acted
as
a
spur.

"Don't
falter,
men,"
called
out
Mori,
urging
the
_karumayas_.
"Ten
_yen_
extra
to
each
if
you
tarry
not
until
I
give
the
word.
On
ahead,
Sumo;
watch
for
the
foreigner.
Be
cautious
and
return
when
you
sight
him."

The
gigantic
_betto_
scurried
up
the
path
in
advance
and
disappeared
past
a
clump
of
bushes.
The
_jinrikishas_
speeded
as
fast
as
their
pullers
could
trot.
As
the
party
darted
by
an
overhanging
mass
of
rock
a
head
was
thrust
forth
from
behind
it.

The
face
of
the
man
was
broad
and
burned
by
the
sun,
and
under
the
chin
was
a
tuft
of
reddish
whisker.
The
eyes
were
sharp
and
piercing,
and
they
danced
with
triumphant
glee
as
they
peered
after
the
cavalcade.

"Oh,
ho!
oh,
ho!
so
it's
ye,
me
bold
Nattie?
It's
a
good
thing
Oi
thought
of
taking
a
quiet
look
to
see
if
Oi
was
being
followed.
It's
a
bit
of
a
trick
Oi
learned
in
India,
and
it'll
prove
to
be
the
death
of
ye,
me
boys.
Oi'll
just
take
another
path
to
the
rendezvous,
and
see
if
we
can't
kind
of
waylay
yez."




CHAPTER
XXIV.

GRANT
BEARDS
THE
LION.


It
is
now
time
to
return
to
Grant
Manning.
It
is
well
for
the
reader
to
know
how
the
lame
youth
became
the
innocent
cause
of
all
the
trouble.
The
night
of
the
departure
of
Nattie
and
Mori
on
their
trip
to
Nagasaki
found
him
through
with
his
work
at
the
usual
hour.

He
parted
from
Mr.
Burr
at
the
door,
and
taking
a
_'rikisha_,
started
for
home.
While
passing
through
Main
Street
near
the
tea
house
where
Nattie
had
played
the
memorable
game
of
hide-and-seek
with
Willis
Round,
he
caught
sight
of
his
friend,
the
secretary
to
the
war
minister.

Grant
was
always
ready
to
do
business.
Years
spent
in
the
counting-room
with
his
father
had
taught
him
the
value
of
personal
influence
in
securing
contracts.
The
expected
order
for
arms
and
ammunition
was
too
valuable
a
prize
for
any
chance
to
be
neglected.

His
acquaintance
with
the
secretary
was
of
long
standing.
It
had
commenced
at
a
private
school
in
Tokio,
which
both
Grant
and
the
Japanese
had
attended
in
earlier
days.
The
boyish
friendship
had
survived
the
passing
of
time--that
greatest
strain
upon
youthful
ties--and
when
the
native
gained
his
present
position
in
the
war
office,
he
remembered
the
Mannings.

The
greeting
was
cordial,
and
an
adjournment
was
made
to
a
private
room
in
the
_chaya_
or
tea
house.
There
the
friends
talked
at
length
over
matters
in
general,
and
Grant
was
given
many
valuable
hints
concerning
the
army
contract.

It
was
past
eight
o'clock
when
the
conference
ended.
With
mutual
_sayonaras_,
or
parting
salutations,
they
separated
at
the
door,
and
Grant
entered
his
waiting
_jinrikisha_.
Before
the
man
could
start
the
vehicle
a
Japanese
boy
ran
up,
and
with
much
bobbing
of
his
quaint
little
head,
begged
the
favor
of
a
word
with
the
excellency.

"What
is
it,
my
lad?"
asked
the
lame
youth,
kindly.

Between
sobs
and
ready
tears
the
boy
explained
that
he
was
the
son
of
one
Go-Daigo,
a
former
porter
in
the
warehouse
under
the
_régime_
of
the
elder
Manning.
He
was
now
ill
of
a
fever,
penniless,
and
in
dire
misfortune.
Would
the
excellency
condescend
to
visit
him
at
his
house
in
a
street
hard
by
the
Shinto
temple?

"I
am
very
sorry
to
hear
of
Go's
misfortune,"
replied
Grant,
with
characteristic
sympathy,
"but
wouldn't
it
answer
the
purpose
if
you
take
this
money,"
producing
several
_yen_,
"and
purchase
food
for
him?
To-morrow
you
can
call
at
the
office
and
I'll
see
what
I
can
do
for
him."

The
excellency's
kindness
was
of
the
quality
called
"first-chop,"
but
the
bedridden
Go-Daigo
was
also
suffering
from
remorse.
He
feared
that
he
would
die,
and
he
did
not
care
to
leave
the
world
with
a
sin-burdened
soul.
He
knew
a
secret
of
value
to
the
new
firm.
Would
the
excellency
call
at
once?

"A
secret
concerning
the
new
firm?"
echoed
Grant,
his
thoughts
instantly
reverting
to
the
Englishman
and
his
son.
"It
may
be
something
of
importance.
Lead
the
way,
child;
I
will
follow."

Ten
minutes'
travel
through
crooked
streets
brought
the
_'rikisha_
to
a
typical
native
house
a
hundred
yards
from
a
large,
red-tiled
temple.
The
youthful
guide
led
the
way
to
the
door
and
opened
it;
then
he
vanished
through
an
alley
between
the
buildings.

Grant
passed
on
in,
finding
himself
in
an
apartment
unfurnished
save
by
a
matting
and
several
cheap
rugs.
A
dim
light
burning
in
one
corner
showed
that
the
room
was
unoccupied.
An
opening
screened
by
a
gaudy
bead
curtain
pierced
the
farther
partition.

Clapping
his
hands
to
give
notice
of
his
arrival,
the
lame
youth
awaited
the
appearance
of
some
one
connected
with
the
house.
Hearing
a
slight
noise
behind
him,
he
turned
in
that
direction.
A
couple
of
stalwart
natives
advanced
toward
him
from
the
outer
door.

Before
Grant
could
ask
a
question,
one
of
them
sprang
upon
him,
and
with
a
vicious
blow
of
a
club,
felled
him
to
the
floor.
The
assault
was
so
rapid
and
withal
so
entirely
unexpected
that
the
unfortunate
victim
had
no
time
to
cry
out,
or
offer
resistance.

As
he
lay
upon
the
matting,
apparently
lifeless,
a
youth
stepped
into
the
room
through
the
bead
curtain.
He
bent
over
the
prostrate
form,
and
after
a
brief
examination,
said,
in
Japanese:

"You
know
how
to
strike,
Raiko.
You
have
put
him
to
sleep
as
easily
as
a
cradle
does
a
drowsy
child.
He
won't
recover
his
senses
for
an
hour
at
least.
Bring
the
cart
and
take
him
down
to
the
landing.
First,
change
his
clothes;
you
may
be
stopped
by
a
policeman."

The
coolie
addressed,
a
stalwart
native,
with
an
evil,
scarred
face,
produced
a
number
of
garments
from
a
chest,
while
his
companion
stripped
Grant
of
his
handsome
business
suit.
A
few
moments
later
he
was
roughly
clad
in
coarse
shoes,
tarry
trousers,
and
an
English
jumper.
A
neckkerchief
and
a
woolen
cap
completed
the
transformation.

As
thus
attired
the
lame
youth
resembled
nothing
more
than
an
English
or
American
deep-water
sailor.
To
add
to
the
disguise,
the
coolie
addressed
as
Raiko,
rubbed
grime
upon
the
delicate
white
hands
and
face.

Then
a
two-wheeled
cart
was
brought
to
the
door,
and
the
pseudo
mariner
dumped
in
and
trundled
down
toward
the
docks.
The
youth,
he
who
had
given
the
orders,
and
who
was,
as
the
reader
has
probably
guessed,
no
other
than
Ralph
Black,
left
the
house
by
another
entrance,
well
pleased
at
the
success
of
his
stratagem.

Raiko
and
his
cart
were
stopped
by
an
inquisitive
gendarme,
but
the
coolie
had
been
primed
with
a
ready
excuse.

"Plenty
_sake_;
foreign
devil,"
he
said,
sententiously.
"He
drunk;
take
him
down
to
ship
for
two
_yen_."

The
officer
of
the
peace
had
seen
many
such
cases
in
his
career,
and
he
sauntered
away
to
reflect
on
the
peculiar
habits
of
the
foreigners
from
beyond
the
water.
On
reaching
the
English
_hatoba_,
or
dock,
Raiko
found
Ralph
awaiting
him.

The
merchant's
son
was
enveloped
in
a
huge
cloak,
and
he
carefully
avoided
the
circles
of
light
cast
by
the
electric
globes.
At
his
command
Grant
was
unceremoniously
dumped
into
a
rowboat
moored
alongside
the
pier,
then
he
followed
with
the
stalwart
coolie.

Lying
out
in
the
bay
was
a
coasting
junk,
with
sails
spread
ready
for
departure.
Pulling
alongside
of
this,
poor
Grant
was
lifted
on
board,
and
ten
minutes
later
the
Japanese
vessel
was
sailing
down
the
Bay
of
Tokio
bound
out.

As
the
ungainly
craft
passed
Cape
King,
and
slouched
clumsily
into
the
tossing
waters
of
the
ocean,
the
lame
youth
groaned,
raised
his
hands
to
his
aching
head,
and
sat
up.
He
glanced
about
him
at
the
unfamiliar
scene,
then
struggled
to
his
feet.
The
swaying
deck
caused
him
to
reel
and
then
stagger
to
the
low
bulwark.

He
thought
he
was
dreaming.
He
looked
at
the
white-capped
waves
shimmering
unsteadily
under
the
moon's
rays;
the
quaint,
ribbed
sails
looming
above;
the
narrow
stretch
of
deck
ending
in
the
high
bow
and
stern,
and
at
the
half-clad
sailors
watching
him
from
the
shadows.

He
glanced
down
at
his
tarred
trousers
and
coarse
shoes,
then
he
gave
a
cry
of
despair.
It
was
not
an
ugly
nightmare.
It
was
stern
reality.
His
enemies
had
triumphed;
he
had
been
abducted.

The
proof
of
valor
is
the
sudden
test
of
a
man's
courage.
The
greatest
coward
can
face
a
peril
if
it
is
familiar
to
him.
It
is
the
unexpected
emergency--the
blow
from
the
dark;
the
onslaught
from
the
rear--that
tries
men's
souls.

The
consternation
caused
by
a
shifting
of
scenes
such
as
had
occurred
to
Grant
can
be
imagined.
From
an
ordinary
room
in
an
ordinary
native
house
in
Yokohama
to
the
deck
of
a
junk
at
sea,
with
all
its
weirdness
of
detail
to
a
landsman,
is
a
decided
change.

The
lame
youth
could
be
excused
if
he
had
sunk
to
the
deck
bewildered
and
in
the
agonies
of
terror.
But
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort.
As
soon
as
he
could
command
the
use
of
his
legs,
he
promptly
marched
over
to
a
sailor
grinning
in
the
shadows
of
the
mainmast,
and
catching
him
by
the
arm,
sternly
ordered
him
to
bring
the
captain.

"Be
sharp
about
it,
you
dog,"
he
added.
"I
will
see
the
master
of
this
pirate
or
know
the
reason
why."

Awed
by
his
tone,
the
fellow
slunk
off
and
speedily
produced
the
captain
of
the
junk.
But
with
him
came
Ralph
Black,
smoking
a
cigar,
and
with
an
insolent
smile
upon
his
sallow
face.

"Ah!
Grant,
dear
boy,"
he
said,
with
a
fine
show
of
good
fellowship;
"I
see
you
have
quite
recovered
from
your
little
accident."

"Accident,
you
scoundrel!"
exclaimed
the
lame
youth.
"What
do
you
mean?
I
demand
an
explanation
of
this
outrage.
Why
am
I
dragged
out
here
like
a
drunken
sailor?
You
must
be
crazy
to
think
that
you
can
perpetrate
such
an
injury
in
this
century
without
being
punished."

"I'll
take
the
chances,"
replied
Ralph,
with
a
sneer.
Then
he
added,
angrily:
"Be
careful
how
you
call
names,
and
remember
once
for
all
that
you
are
in
my
power,
and
if
I
say
the
word,
these
sailors
will
feed
you
to
the
sharks.
In
fact,
I
really
think
it
would
be
best,
anyway."

"I
always
thought
you
off
color,
but
I
never
believed
you
would
prove
to
be
such
a
cold-blooded
villain
as
you
undoubtedly
are.
You
and
your
worthy
father
couldn't
meet
business
rivals
in
the
open
field
of
competition,
but
you
needs
must
resort
to
violence
and
underhand
methods.
I'll
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
both
of
you
behind
the
bars
before----"

With
a
snarl
of
rage,
the
merchant's
son
sprang
upon
the
daring
speaker.
Grasping
him
by
the
throat,
he
called
loudly
to
the
junk's
captain:

"Over
with
him,
Yoritomo!
Help
me
throw
him
into
the
sea.
Dead
men
tell
no
tales!"




CHAPTER
XXV.

A
PLAN,
AND
ITS
FAILURE.


The
lower
order
of
criminals
are
seldom
courageous.
Personal
bravery
is
not
found
in
the
same
soul
that
harbors
a
disregard
for
laws
human
and
divine.
The
thief
cornered
in
the
dark
will
fight,
but
simply
with
the
desperation
of
a
rat
at
bay.

It
was
to
this
natural
law
that
Grant
owed
his
life.
Yoritomo,
the
captain
of
the
junk,
was
a
scoundrel
at
heart,
but
he
had
a
wholesome
regard
for
justice
as
meted
out
in
Japan.
A
number
of
years
spent
on
the
penal
farms
had
taught
him
discrimination.

While
there
he
had
witnessed--and
even
assisted
at--several
executions
for
murder,
and
the
terror
of
the
scene
remained
with
him.
A
golden
bribe
offered
by
the
Blacks
had
purchased
his
services
in
the
abduction
of
Grant,
but
when
Ralph,
in
his
insane
rage,
called
to
him
for
assistance
in
throwing
the
lame
youth
into
the
sea,
he
peremptorily
refused.

Instead,
he
called
several
sailors
to
his
aid,
and
rescued
Grant
from
Ralph's
grasp.

"I'll
permit
of
no
murder
on
my
junk,"
he
said
in
Japanese.
"You
have
paid
me
well
to
help
you
carry
this
fellow
to
the
Bay
of
Sendai,
and
I
will
do
it,
but
no
violence,
sir."

"What
do
you
mean,
dog?"
shouted
the
discomfited
youth.
"How
dare
you
interfere?
If
I
wish
to
get
rid
of
him
I'll
do
so."

"Not
on
board
this
vessel,"
replied
the
captain,
doggedly.

"I
suppose
you
are
afraid
of
your
neck?"
sneered
Ralph.

"Yes,
I
am.
I
run
enough
danger
as
it
is.
How
do
we
know
that
we
were
not
seen
in
Yokohama?
My
craft
is
engaged
in
trade
along
the
coast,
and
is
well
known.
When
your
prisoner's
absence
is
found
out
the
authorities
will
secure
a
list
of
all
shipping
leaving
the
port
on
such
a
date.
I
will
be
suspected
with
the
rest."

Ralph
remained
silent.
A
craven
at
heart,
he
would
not
have
dared
attack
one
physically
able
to
offer
resistance.
The
picture
drawn
by
the
captain
was
not
pleasant.
What
if
the
truth
should
be
discovered?
It
would
mean
disgrace
and
a
long
term
in
prison.
And
he
had
just
contemplated
a
murder!

The
punishment
for
such
a
crime
is
death.
The
youth
shuddered
at
his
narrow
escape.
He
scowled
at
his
prisoner,
then
stalked
aft
to
the
mean
little
cabin
under
the
shadow
of
the
wing-like
sails.

Grant
had
been
a
silent
spectator
of
the
scene.
When
Ralph
made
the
violent
attack
on
him,
he
struggled
as
best
he
could,
but
he
was
no
match
for
his
athletic
assailant,
and
would
have
undoubtedly
succumbed
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
timely
aid
of
the
captain.

The
latter's
unexpected
action
sent
a
ray
of
hope
through
the
lame
youth.
Possibly
he
could
be
bribed
to
further
assist
him!
Grant
was
philosopher
enough
to
know
that
honor
does
not
exist
among
thieves.
The
bonds
of
fraternity
found
among
honest
men
is
unknown
in
the
criminal
walks
of
life.

When
Ralph
left
the
deck
Grant
drew
Yoritomo
aside,
and
boldly
proposed
a
plan
evolved
at
that
moment
by
his
fertile
brain.
He
did
not
mince
words,
but
went
to
the
point
at
once.

"Captain,
a
word
with
you,"
he
said.
"I
wish
to
tell
you
that
you
are
making
a
bad
mistake
in
being
a
party
to
this
abduction.
You
probably
know
the
laws
of
your
country,
but
you
do
not
know
that
such
crimes
against
foreigners
are
punishable
by
death
in
many
cases."

Yoritomo
shifted
uneasily,
but
made
no
reply.

"Do
you
know
who
I
am?"
continued
Grant,
impressively.

The
captain
shook
his
head.

"Indeed!
You
must
belong
to
one
of
the
lower
provinces,
then.
Have
you
ever
heard
of
the
firm
of
Manning
&
Company,
dealers
and
importing
merchants?"

"Yes."

"Well,
my
name
is
Grant
Manning,
and
I
am
now
head
of
the
firm.
I
am
also
a
personal
friend
of
his
excellency,
Yoshisada
Udono,
of
the
War
Department,
and
of
the
Superintendent
of
Prisons
in
Tokio.
Ah,
I
see
that
you
know
what
the
latter
means.
You
have
been
a
prisoner
in
your
time,
eh?"

"Yes,
excellency."

The
words
were
respectful,
and
the
lame
youth
took
hope.
He
followed
up
his
advantage.

"The
young
man
who
bribed
you
to
assist
in
his
nefarious
plot
is
crazy.
No
sane
man
would
attempt
such
a
desperate
scheme
nowadays.
You
are
sure
to
be
discovered
before
many
days.
The
detectives
are
even
now
after
you.
I
have
relatives
and
friends
who
will
move
heaven
and
earth
to
rescue
me,
or
to
secure
revenge
if
aught
happens
to
me.
Discovery
means
death
to
you.
You
are
even
now
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
gallows."

Grant
had
lowered
his
voice
to
an
impressive
whisper.
The
tone,
the
surroundings,
the
situation
had
their
effect
upon
the
listener.
He
trembled
from
head
to
foot.
He
fell
upon
his
knees
at
his
companion's
feet
and
begged
for
mercy.

"Oh,
excellency,"
he
pleaded,
"I
crave
your
pardon.
I
acknowledge
that
I
am
guilty.
Mr.
Black
offered
me
a
large
sum
to
help
in
your
abduction.
I
need
the
money,
for
I
am
very
poor.
I
accepted,
and
now
I
lose
my
life."

"Not
necessarily
so,"
replied
the
lame
youth,
repressing
a
feeling
of
exultation
with
difficulty.
"If
you
will
do
as
I
say
I
will
assure
you
of
a
pardon,
and
promise
you
money
in
addition.
What
did
the
Blacks
agree
to
pay
you?"

"Two
hundred
_yen_,
excellency."

"And
for
that
paltry
sum,
not
equal
to
one
hundred
American
dollars,
you
have
run
such
risks.
You
are
a
fool!"

"Yes,
excellency."

"Now,
I'll
promise
to
see
that
you
are
not
punished,
and
I
will
also
give
you
twice
that
amount
if
you
head
in
to
the
nearest
port
and
put
me
ashore.
What
do
you
say?"

Yoritomo
hesitated.

"Remember
your
fate
when
the
authorities
capture
you,
which
they
surely
will
before
long.
Don't
be
a
dolt,
man.
I
will
pay
you
double
what
the
Blacks
promise,
and
assure
you
of
a
pardon
besides."

"Can
you
pay
me
the
money
now?"
asked
the
captain,
cunningly.

He
had
evidently
recovered
from
his
fears--enough,
anyway,
to
drive
a
shrewd
bargain.

"Part
of
it,
and
give
you
good
security
for
the
balance,"
replied
Grant,
confidently.

He
reached
in
the
pocket
where
he
generally
kept
his
purse,
but
found
it
empty.
A
hurried
search
disclosed
the
fact
that
his
valuable
gold
watch
and
a
small
diamond
stud
were
also
gone.
He
had
been
robbed.

"The
confounded
thieves!"
he
exclaimed.
"They
have
completely
stripped
me."

"Then
you
have
no
money?"
asked
Yoritomo,
incredulously.

"No;
I
have
been
robbed
by
those
people.
I
will
give
you
my
word
that
I'll
pay
you
the
four
hundred
_yen_
the
moment
I
set
foot
in
Yokohama.
Or,
if
you
wish,
I'll
write
a
note
for
the
amount,
and
you
can
collect
it
at
any
time."

"Have
you
anything
to
prove
that
you
are
Grant
Manning?"
queried
the
captain,
suspiciously.

Grant
bit
his
lips
in
annoyance.
The
question
boded
ill
for
his
chances
of
escape.
The
hurried
search
through
his
pockets
had
shown
him
that
he
had
nothing
left;
not
even
a
letter
or
a
scrap
of
paper.
He
was
compelled
to
answer
in
the
negative.

"I
thought
so,"
cried
Yoritomo,
scornfully.
"You
have
tried
to
play
a
pretty
game,
my
brave
youth,
but
it
didn't
work.
You
Grant
Manning?
Ha!
ha!
ha!
Mr.
Black
told
me
who
you
are.
You
are
a
rival
in
love,
and
he
is
taking
this
means
of
getting
rid
of
you.
So
you
would
try
to
wheedle
me
with
lies?
I
have
a
mind
to
let
him
throw
you
overboard
as
he
intended.
Begone
forward,
or
I'll
tell
my
men
to
scourge
you!"

"You
are
making
a
serious
mistake,"
replied
Grant,
with
dignity.
"You
will
live
to
repent
your
actions.
I
am----"

"Begone,
I
say!"
interrupted
the
captain,
menacingly.
"Here,
Tomo,
Haki,
drive
this
fool
forward!"

Sick
at
heart
and
almost
discouraged,
the
lame
youth
limped
toward
the
bow.
As
he
passed
the
mainmast
a
coolie
slipped
from
behind
it
and
entered
the
cabin.
It
was
Raiko,
Ralph's
man.
He
had
overheard
the
futile
attempt,
and
proceeded
forthwith
to
tell
his
master.




CHAPTER
XXVI.

GRANT
ATTEMPTS
TO
ESCAPE.


During
the
rest
of
the
voyage
up
the
coast
Grant
was
kept
forward
with
the
sailors.
Ralph
carefully
avoided
him,
and,
in
fact,
seldom
appeared
on
deck.

Shortly
before
midnight
on
the
second
day
out
the
prisoner
was
awakened
from
a
troubled
sleep
by
the
entrance
of
several
men
in
his
little
apartment
forward.
One
of
these
was
Raiko.
Without
a
word
of
explanation,
the
coolie
seized
Grant
and
with
the
aid
of
his
companions,
bound
him
hand
and
foot.

An
hour
later
the
junk
was
brought
to
anchor
and
the
sails
furled.
Then
a
boat
was
lowered,
and
Grant,
Ralph,
and
Raiko
were
rowed
ashore
by
members
of
the
crew.
As
they
left
the
craft,
Yoritomo
leaned
over
the
clumsy
rail,
and
called
out,
sneeringly:

"How
about
that
four
hundred
_yen_
and
the
free
pardon?
Your
little
plan
didn't
work,
eh?
Farewell,
excellency,
Grant
Manning!"

The
prisoner
maintained
a
dignified
silence,
but
at
heart
he
felt
sore
and
discouraged.
While
on
the
junk
he
considered
himself
almost
safe
from
violence,
but
Ralph's
cowardly
assault
and
the
grim,
evil
face
of
the
coolie.
Raiko,
boded
little
good.

The
night
was
clear,
and
a
full
moon
cast
its
mellow
rays
over
the
scene.
The
junk
had
anchored
in
an
extensively
landlocked
bay.
Across
to
the
right
were
several
twinkling
lights,
proclaiming
the
presence
of
a
town.
But
where
the
boat
had
landed
were
simply
clumps
of
bushes
and
sandy
dunes.

The
little
party
set
out
at
once
for
the
interior.
Grant's
feet
had
been
loosened,
but
his
hands
still
remained
fastened.
Raiko
walked
in
advance,
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
country.
At
the
end
of
the
first
hour
a
halt
was
made
in
a
grove
of
trees
near
a
hill.

The
coolie
disappeared,
leaving
the
prisoner
in
Ralph's
care.
After
he
had
gone
Grant
attempted
to
engage
the
merchant's
son
in
conversation,
but
without
avail.
He
absolutely
refused
to
speak.
Presently
Raiko
returned
with
three
horses
and
another
native.

The
lame
youth
was
lifted
upon
one
and
secured
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
not
escape;
then
the
others
were
mounted
by
the
remaining
members
of
the
party
and
the
march
resumed.

Raiko
went
first,
as
usual,
then
Ralph,
leading
the
prisoner's
steed,
and
finally
the
new
coolie
bringing
up
the
rear.
It
was
a
strange
procession,
but
there
were
none
to
witness
it,
the
narrow
paths
followed
being
entirely
deserted.

Several
hours
passed
in
this
manner.
The
moon
sank
behind
the
western
mountains,
leaving
the
scene
in
darkness.
Mile
after
mile
was
covered
without
a
halt.
The
aspect
of
the
country
changed
from
hill
to
plain,
from
valley
to
heights.
Rivers
were
forded,
bridges
crossed,
and
lakes
skirted,
and
still
no
word
between
the
members
of
the
cavalcade.

During
all
this
time
Grant
had
not
remained
idle.
He
was
not
a
youth
prone
to
despair.
The
result
of
his
conversation
with
the
junk's
captain
had
certainly
discouraged
him
for
the
moment,
but
with
the
vivacity
of
youth
he
speedily
recovered
his
spirits
and
set
about
for
a
way
to
better
his
situation.

In
the
first
place,
he
found
that
the
jolting
of
his
mount,
which
he
had
railed
against
at
the
commencement,
had
actually
loosened
his
bonds.
His
arms
had
been
tied
behind
him
with
a
leather
thong
around
the
wrists
and
elbows.

The
discovery
sent
a
thrill
of
hope
through
him.
Working
steadily,
but
without
making
the
slightest
sound,
he
finally
succeeded
in
freeing
both
hands.
The
operation
took
some
time,
and
it
was
not
until
after
the
moon
had
disappeared
that
he
completed
the
task.

Meanwhile,
his
mind
had
also
moved
rapidly.
He
formulated
a
plan.
It
was
nothing
less
than
to
wait
for
a
favorable
opportunity,
and
to
make
a
bold
dash
for
freedom.
Burdened
as
he
was,
with
a
deformed
and
feeble
frame,
Grant
was
no
coward,
nor
was
he
lacking
in
valor
of
spirit.

He
knew
that
the
attempt
would
be
productive
of
danger.
It
would
draw
the
fire
of
his
companions,
and,
moreover,
lead
to
terrible
risks
to
life
and
limb,
but
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
brave
all
if
by
so
doing
he
could
effect
his
escape.

During
the
weary
hours
spent
on
board
the
junk
he
had
thought
over
his
abduction
and
the
events
leading
to
it.
The
actions
of
the
Blacks
were
almost
inexplicable.
It
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
they
would
resort
to
such
desperate
measures.

He
had
read
of
such
cases
in
books
of
romance
treating
of
life
in
the
earlier
centuries,
but
to
believe
that
an
English
merchant
in
Japan
should
carry
off
a
business
rival
in
the
present
day
was
almost
beyond
his
credulity.

"It
is
the
last
move
of
a
man
driven
to
the
wall,"
he
had
concluded,
and
not
without
a
feeling
of
triumph,
it
must
be
confessed.
"We
have
taken
the
market
from
him,
and
simply
because
the
market
chose
to
come
to
us,
and
we
have
beaten
his
firm
and
others
in
both
the
export
and
import
trades.
And
as
a
final
straw,
it
seemed
as
if
the
valuable
army
contracts
would
also
come
to
us.
Fool!
he
should
have
known
that
Nattie
and
Mori
could
easily
secure
them
even
if
I
had
dropped
out
of
sight."

This
was
not
so,
and
only
his
innate
sense
of
modesty
compelled
him
to
say
it.
Nattie
and
Mori,
the
Blacks,
and
all
the
foreign
population
of
Japan
knew
that
only
Grant
could
win
the
prize.
His
business
tact,
his
personal
friendship
with
the
powers
at
the
head
of
the
government,
and
his
well-known
reputation
for
honesty
were
the
virtues
forming
the
magnet
that
would
attract
the
golden
plum.

The
outrageous
assault
of
Ralph
on
board
the
junk
had
shown
Grant
how
desperate
his
enemies
were.
It
hinted
strongly
at
nothing
short
of
murder.
No
man,
no
matter
how
brave,
can
walk
in
the
shadow
of
a
threatened
death
without
inwardly
wishing
himself
free
from
danger.

Grant
was
as
others
in
the
same
situation.
He
was
willing
to
face
any
known
peril
to
escape
the
unknown
fate
awaiting
him
at
the
end
of
the
journey.
Then
he
had
a
natural
desire
to
turn
the
tables
on
his
enemies;
to
cause
their
defeat
and
punishment,
and
not
least
of
all,
to
reach
Tokio
in
time
to
secured
the
coveted
army
contracts.

As
the
night
became
darker
the
little
party
hovered
together.
As
stated
before,
Ralph
was
leading
Grant's
horse,
and
forming
the
rear
of
the
cavalcade
was
the
new
coolie.
Raiko
was
almost
out
of
sound
ahead.

The
lame
youth
felt
in
his
pockets,
and
to
his
great
joy
found
a
penknife
which
had
been
overlooked
by
the
greedy
coolie.
Waiting
until
they
rode
into
a
narrow
valley
running
between
high
hills,
the
prisoner
softly
reached
forward
and
severed
the
leading
thong.
Then,
with
a
fierce
tug
of
his
hands,
he
caused
his
mount
to
wheel
sharply.

This
sudden
action
brought
the
horse
ridden
by
Grant
in
collision
with
that
of
the
hindmost
coolie.
The
shock
unseated
the
fellow,
who
was
naturally
unprepared,
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
cry
of
terror.
Belaboring
his
steed
with
one
hand,
the
prisoner
dashed
down
the
valley
like
a
whirlwind.

He
had
not
gone
fifty
yards
before
he
heard
a
prodigious
clatter
of
hoofs,
then
with
a
loud
report
a
revolver
was
discharged
behind
him.
The
bullet
flew
wide
of
the
mark,
as
could
be
expected
under
the
circumstances,
but
it
served
its
purpose
just
the
same.

At
the
sound
Grant's
horse
dashed
sideways,
stumbled
over
a
hummock
of
earth
or
rock,
and
with
a
crash,
animal
and
rider
fell
in
a
heap
against
the
edge
of
rising
ground.
Fortunately,
the
lame
youth
escaped
injury,
but
the
terrific
fall
partially
stunned
him,
and
he
was
unable
to
resist
when,
a
moment
later,
Ralph
rode
up
and
seized
him.

Raiko
followed
close
behind,
and
the
other
coolie
limped
up
in
time
to
assist
in
rebinding
the
prisoner.
After
seeing
him
again
seated
upon
the
horse,
Ralph
launched
forth
in
a
tirade
of
abuse,
which
he
emphasized
by
brutally
striking
the
prisoner
with
his
whip.

"Thought
you
would
give
us
the
slip,
eh?"
he
cried.
"You
crippled
puppy.
I've
a
good
notion
to
beat
you
to
death!
We're
having
too
much
trouble
with
you,
anyway,
and
I
think
I
will
end
it
right
here."

"You
will
receive
full
measure
for
this
outrage
some
day,
you
coward,"
retorted
Grant,
whose
discomfiture
had
made
him
careless
of
consequences.
"None
but
a
brute
would
act
as
you
are
doing.
No,
I'll
not
stop
talking.
I
don't
care
a
snap
of
my
little
finger
for
your
threats.
Do
what
you
please,
but
remember
there
will
be
a
day
of
retribution."

The
English
youth
evidently
thought
so,
too,
as
he
desisted,
and
mounting,
rode
ahead
with
the
leading
strap
attached
to
his
saddle.
This
time
extra
precautions
were
taken.
Grant's
legs
were
fastened
by
a
thong
running
under
his
horse,
and
his
arms
were
securely
bound.

The
journey
was
continued
without
halt
or
incident
until
a
gradual
lighting
of
the
eastern
sky
proclaimed
the
advent
of
dawn.
The
first
rays
of
the
sun
found
the
cavalcade
upon
the
summit
of
a
verdure-crowned
hill.
Down
below,
nestling
in
the
center
of
an
extensive
valley,
was
the
shimmering
waters
of
a
large
lake,
and,
looming
massively
on
the
farther
shore,
could
be
seen
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
feudal
castle.

"Thank
goodness!
the
rendezvous
at
last!"
exclaimed
Ralph.
"Now,
to
see
if
Patrick
is
here
before
us."




CHAPTER
XXVII.

IN
FRONT
OF
THE
OLD
CASTLE.


In
the
meantime
how
had
Nattie
and
his
party
fared
in
their
pursuit
of
the
wily
Irishman?
It
will
be
remembered
that
Sumo
had
gone
ahead
as
a
scout,
leaving
the
others
to
follow
more
at
leisure.
This
was
found
necessary
by
the
increasing
difficulty
of
drawing
the
_jinrikishas_
along
the
primitive
path.

It
had
narrowed
in
places
to
such
an
extent
that
only
by
the
most
careful
efforts
could
the
vehicles
be
taken
past.
The
road
became
obstructed
with
huge
bowlders,
fallen
from
the
surrounding
heights,
and
finally
the
trunk
of
a
large
tree,
shattered
by
lightning,
was
encountered.

"We
will
have
to
leave
the
_'rikishas_
in
charge
of
one
of
the
men,"
answered
Nattie,
regretfully.

"It
will
handicap
us
considerably,"
replied
Mori,
in
the
same
tone.
"We
cannot
expect
to
catch
up
with
Patrick,
mounted
as
he
is.
From
the
speed
he
has
been
making,
though,
his
animal
must
be
tired
out.
I
think--what
is
up
now?"

The
question
was
called
forth
by
a
peculiar
action
on
Nattie's
part.
The
lad
had
been
standing
intently
eying
the
fallen
monarch
of
the
forest.
Suddenly
he
tossed
his
helmet
into
the
air
with
a
cry
of
joy.

"What
fools
we
are!"
he
added.
"Why,
this
tree
has
been
here
at
least
a
month."

"Well,
what
of
it?"

"Mori,
I
am
ashamed
of
you.
Can't
you
see
that
a
horse
couldn't
pass
here?
Look
at
those
limbs
and
that
mass
of
foliage.
If
Patrick
is
ahead
of
us
he
must
have
abandoned
his
horse.
Where
is
the
animal?"

"By
Jove!
you
are
right.
The
Irishman
must
have
doubled
on
us
after
meeting
that
priest.
Idiots
that
we
are
to
permit
a
man
like
that
to
pull
the
wool
over
our
eyes.
We
must
go
back
and
take
the
other
road."

Before
Nattie
could
reply,
Sumo
scrambled
over
the
tree
and
advanced
toward
them.

"Masters,
the
red-bearded
foreigner
has
deceived
us.
I
met
a
man
half
a
_ris_
up
the
path.
He
has
been
working
there
since
daylight,
and
he
says
no
one
has
passed
him
except
the
priest."

"That
settles
it,"
exclaimed
Mori.

"Come;
we
must
return
to
the
crossroad."

"I
have
also
learned
that
this
path
and
the
main
road
meet
about
five
_ris_
beyond
this
hill,"
continued
Sumo.

The
coolie's
information
was
indeed
welcome,
and
little
time
was
lost
in
retracing
their
steps.
On
reaching
the
crossroad,
however,
darkness,
which
had
been
threatening
for
some
time,
settled
down.
The
coming
of
night
presented
a
serious
obstacle
to
the
continuation
of
the
pursuit.

"I
am
afraid
we
must
put
up
somewhere
until
morning,"
said
Mori,
as
the
party
halted.

Nattie
instantly
expostulated.

"We
will
never
be
able
to
trace
Patrick,"
he
insisted.
"No,
we
must
keep
on,
darkness
or
no
darkness."

"And
run
the
risk
of
passing
him
during
the
night,
eh?
If
he
is
cunning
enough
to
fool
us
once,
he'll
certainly
try
it
again.
No,
our
best
plan
is
to
proceed
to
Invoro,
a
small
village,
a
couple
of
miles
from
here,
and
rest
until
daylight.
Then
we
can
resume
the
pursuit
with
some
chance
of
tracking
the
Irishman.
Anyway,
we
are
reasonably
certain
his
destination
is
the
caves
at
the
foot
of
Bandai-San."

Nattie
was
forced
to
acknowledge
the
wisdom
of
his
companion's
plan,
but
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
he
gave
his
consent.
The
trip
to
the
village
was
made
without
incident.
Accommodations
were
secured
at
a
primitive
tea
house,
and
preparations
made
for
spending
the
night.

Inquiry
elicited
the
cheering
news
that
a
foreigner
such
as
described
had
passed
through
the
town
several
hours
previous.
He
had
halted
to
secure
food
for
himself
and
horse,
and
had
then
continued
his
journey.

"We
are
still
on
the
right
track,
you
see,"
said
Mori,
to
Nattie.
"Don't
worry,
old
boy.
This
road
leads
to
the
volcano,
and
all
we
need
do
is
to
set
out
at
daybreak
and
go
straight
to
the
caves.
I
am
so
sure
that
we
will
find
Grant
there
that
I
have
dispatched
a
messenger
to
the
governor
of
this
district
asking
for
the
assistance
of
the
rural
police."

"I
don't
place
much
faith
in
them,"
replied
Nattie,
doubtfully.
"I
think
we
had
better
proceed
alone
until
we
are
thoroughly
sure
Ralph
Black
and
Grant
are
at
the
caves.
Then
we
can
send
for
reinforcements.
A
large
body
of
police
would
only
give
the
alarm,
and
probably
drive
them
somewhere
else
in
search
of
a
hiding
place."

"All
right;
I
will
leave
word
to
hold
the
gendarmes
here
until
we
call
for
them.
Now
try
to
get
a
little
sleep.
You
will
tire
yourself
out
and
retard
the
recovery
of
that
shoulder."

The
lad
protested
that
he
could
not
close
his
eyes,
but
nature
demanded
her
meed
of
rest,
and
he
slumbered
soundly
until
the
party
was
called
at
the
first
signs
of
day.
After
a
brief
breakfast
the
chase
was
resumed,
all
feeling
remarkably
refreshed
by
the
night's
rest.

"I
feel
like
a
new
man,"
announced
Mori,
quaffing
huge
draughts
of
the
brisk
morning
air
from
his
_'rikisha_.
"I
really
believe
I
am
good
for
a
dozen
Patricks
if
it
comes
to
a
tussle."

"Which
it
is
bound
to
do,"
replied
Nattie,
cheerily.
"You
can
anticipate
a
fight,
old
fellow.
Ralph
Black
and
Willis
Round
will
not
give
up
without
a
struggle.
Why,
imagine
what
defeat
means
to
them!
They
will
be
compelled
to
leave
the
country
immediately."

"If
we
permit
them
to,"
interposed
the
Japanese
youth,
meaningly.
"Yes,
you
are
right.
With
their
scheme
ruined,
the
house
of
Black
will
tumble
like
a
mansion
built
of
cards.
If
captured,
they
will
be
brought
to
trial
before
the
English
Minister
and
probably
sentenced
to
a
long
term
in
prison.
They
must
have
been
desperate
to
resort
to
such
a
plan."

"It's
gold--bright,
yellow
gold,
my
dear
boy,"
replied
his
companion,
sagely.
"It
is
only
another
case
of
man
selling
his
liberty,
if
not
his
soul,
for
the
almighty
dollar.
The
hundred
thousand
_yen_
profit
in
those
army
contracts
proved
too
much
for
the
Englishman.
And
I
guess
personal
revenge
has
something
to
do
with
it."

"No
doubt.
Still
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
a
sane
man
would
take
such
chances.
I
wonder
what
they
expected
to
do
after
the
awarding
of
the
contracts?
They
surely
could
not
hope
to
keep
Grant
a
prisoner
for
many
months?"

"I
have
thought
it
over,
and
I
believe
Mr.
Black
expected
to
clear
out
after
furnishing
the
arms
and
ammunition,
if
he
secured
the
prize.
He
felt
that
his
business
had
dwindled
after
the
organization
of
our
firm,
and
that
he
might
as
well
retire
with
the
money
realized
if
he
could.
He
did
not
anticipate
that
we
would
discover
his
plot
and
pursue
his
son."

"Well,
I
am
glad
to
say
that
he
is
mightily
mistaken."

The
invigorating
air
of
the
early
morning
hours
caused
the
_jinrikisha_
men
to
race
along
the
road
at
their
utmost
speed,
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
party
arrived
at
the
spot
where
the
path
taken
the
night
before
rejoined
the
main
thoroughfare.

A
short
rest
was
taken,
then,
with
renewed
strength,
the
pursuit
was
continued.
At
the
end
of
an
hour
a
lake
was
sighted
some
distance
ahead.
It
was
a
large
body
of
water,
evidently
grandly
situated
in
a
basin
formed
by
three
hills
and
a
lofty
mountain.
Pointing
to
the
latter,
which
reared
its
conical
head
twelve
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
lake,
Mori
said,
impressively:

"The
volcano
of
Bandai-San."

"And
at
its
base
are
the
caves?"
eagerly
asked
Nattie.

"Yes,
the
mud
caves
where
we
hope
Ralph
and
Mr.
Round
have
taken
their
prisoner."

"What
is
that
on
the
edge
of
the
lake?
It
seems
to
be
a
ruin."

"That's
the
_shiro_,
or
old
castle
of
Yamagata.
By
Jove!
I
had
forgotten
that
it
was
here.
It
is
a
feudal
pile,
and
has
a
quaint
history.
I
will
tell
you
something
of
it
as
we
ride
along.
The
road
passes
the
entrance."

Bidding
the
_karumayas_
run
together,
Mori
continued:

"It
was
a
stronghold
of
an
ancient
_daimio_,
or
prince.
He
ruled
the
country
around
here
for
many
years.
He
was
very
wealthy,
and
spent
an
immense
sum
of
money
on
the
castle.
You
can
see
by
its
extent
and
the
material
that
it
cost
no
small
amount.
The
walls
are
of
stone,
some
of
the
blocks
being
forty
feet
long
by
ten
feet
in
width,
and
many
have
a
thickness
of
an
English
yard.

"Those
two
lofty
towers
were
once
surmounted
with
huge
fish
made
of
copper,
and
covered
with
plates
of
gold.
You
can
imagine
the
temptation
to
the
peasants.
One
windy
night
a
robber
mounted
an
immense
kite
and
tried
to
fly
to
the
top
of
the
first
tower
for
the
purpose
of
stealing
the
golden
scales,
but
he
was
caught
and
boiled
alive
in
oil."

"They
had
an
extremely
pleasant
manner
of
executing
people
in
Japan
in
the
early
days,"
remarked
Nattie,
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders.

"Yes,
but
during
the
same
period,
my
boy,
the
English
broke
their
criminals
on
a
wheel,
and
quartered
them.
It
was
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other."

By
this
time
the
party
had
neared
the
ruined
entrance
to
the
castle.
Nattie's
curiosity
had
been
aroused
by
Mori's
tale,
and
he
leaned
forward
to
tell
his
_jinrikisha_
man
to
stop,
when
there
came
a
clattering
of
hoofs
from
the
interior
of
the
castle,
and
a
cavalcade
rode
out
upon
the
broken
drawbridge.

Hoarse
cries
of
mutual
surprise
rang
out,
then
both
parties
came
to
a
sudden
halt
facing
each
other.
A
wild
shout
of
joy
came
from
Nattie:

"Grant!
Grant!
I
have
found
you
at
last!"




CHAPTER
XXVIII.

SUMO'S
ARMY.


For
a
better
understanding
of
what
follows
it
will
be
well
to
explain
the
situation
of
the
castle
of
Yamagata,
and
its
general
construction.

It
was
located
on
the
southern
edge
of
Lake
Inawashiro,
and
covered
a
large
extent
of
ground.

The
main
portion
of
the
building
was
well
preserved,
consisting
of
a
line
of
massive
stone
battlements
with
a
lofty
tower
at
each
end.
In
the
interior
rose
a
shattered
wall,
all
that
was
left
of
the
extensive
partitions.

There
were
two
entrances,
one
at
the
main
drawbridge,
still
in
good
condition,
and
another
nearer
the
lake.
The
latter
was
choked
up
with
stones
and
various
_débris_.
A
moat
ran
around
three
sides
of
the
pile,
connecting
with
the
lake,
which
touched
the
fourth
wall.

The
road
ran
past
the
front
of
the
castle,
and
in
the
vicinity
were
numerous
huts
occupied
by
coolies
working
in
the
rice
fields.
An
extensive
forest
of
maple
and
willows
lined
a
good
part
of
the
lake.
Rising
in
the
distance
to
the
north
was
the
majestic
peak
of
Bandai-San.

So
much
for
description.

When
Nattie
and
Mori
heard
the
tramping
of
horses
in
the
interior
they
were
entirely
unprepared
to
see
issue
from
the
main
entrance
a
cavalcade
composed
of
Ralph
Black,
Willis
Round
and
Patrick
Cronin,
with
Grant
a
prisoner
in
the
center.

The
party
was
further
augmented
by
Raiko
and
two
brother
coolies.
For
an
instant
the
mutual
surprise
was
so
great
that
neither
side
made
a
movement.
Nattie
broke
the
spell
by
leaping
from
his
_'rikisha_
with
the
glad
cry:

"Grant!
Grant!
I
have
found
you
at
last!"

The
words
had
scarcely
left
his
lips
when
Ralph
Black,
who
was
in
advance,
dashed
the
spurs
into
his
horse,
and
whirled
around.
There
was
a
brief
scramble
and
confusion,
then
the
whole
cavalcade
rode
helter-skelter
back
into
the
castle.

Grant
was
dragged
with
them,
being
still
tied
hand
and
foot.
An
instant
later,
an
ancient
portcullis,
which
had
survived
the
ravages
of
time,
fell
into
place
with
a
crash,
completely
blocking
the
entrance.

The
sudden
retreat
of
Ralph
and
his
party
left
Nattie
and
Mori
staring
after
them
as
if
powerless
to
move.
Their
inaction
did
not
last
long,
however.
Wild
with
rage
they
darted
across
the
drawbridge,
but
only
to
find
the
portcullis--an
arrangement
of
timbers
joined
across
one
another
after
the
manner
of
a
harrow--barring
their
way.

Seizing
one
part
of
it,
Nattie
attempted
to
force
himself
through,
but
he
was
met
with
a
bullet
that
whizzed
past
his
head
in
dangerous
proximity
to
that
useful
member.
Simultaneous
with
the
report
there
appeared
on
the
other
side
Ralph
and
the
ex-bookkeeper.

Both
carried
revolvers,
which
they
flourished
menacingly.
Deeming
discretion
the
better
part
of
valor,
Nattie
and
Mori
dodged
behind
a
projecting
corner
of
the
massive
entrance.
A
taunting
laugh
came
to
their
ears.

"Why
don't
you
come
in
and
rescue
your
brother,
you
coward?"
called
out
the
merchant's
son.
"What
are
you
afraid
of?"

The
epithet
and
the
insulting
tone
was
too
much
for
Nattie's
hot
young
blood,
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
rushing
forth
from
his
shelter,
regardless
of
consequences,
when
he
was
forcibly
detained
by
Mori.

"Stop!
Don't
be
foolish,"
explained
the
young
Japanese.
"He
is
only
trying
to
get
a
shot
at
you."

"But
I
can't
stand
being
called
a
coward
by
a
cur
like
that."

"We
will
repay
him
in
good
time.
We
have
them
cornered,
and
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
see
that
they
don't
get
away
while
we
send
for
the
authorities.
Don't
ruin
everything
by
your
rashness."

"Why
don't
you
storm
the
castle
like
the
knights
of
old?"
jeered
Ralph,
just
then.
"We
are
waiting
for
you."

"You
are
a
scoundrel
and
a
fool,"
retorted
Nattie,
grimly,
heeding
his
companion's
advice.
"We've
got
you
in
a
trap,
and
we'll
mighty
soon
turn
you
and
your
brother
conspirators
over
to
the
law."

"Talk
is
cheap,"
replied
a
voice
from
within
the
castle,
but
there
was
far
less
confidence
in
the
tone.
The
speaker
was
Willis
Round.
Presently
Patrick
made
himself
heard.

"Why
don't
yez
lift
that
fine-tooth
comb
thing
and
go
out
and
fight
them?"
he
asked,
impatiently.
"It's
meself
that
can
whip
the
whole
lot,
although
Oi
shouldn't
be
the
one
to
tell
it.
Sally
forth,
Oi
say,
and
sweep
the
spalpanes
intid
the
lake."

It
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
his
belligerent
proposal
was
not
adopted
by
his
more
discreet
companions.
There
was
a
murmur
of
voices,
as
if
the
three
were
holding
a
consultation,
then
all
became
quiet.

In
the
meantime,
Nattie
and
Mori
looked
about
them.
Back
in
the
road
were
the
_karumayas_,
still
standing
near
their
_jinrikishas_.
One
of
the
porters
was
with
them,
but
Sumo
had
disappeared.
The
absence
of
the
giant
native
struck
the
boys
as
peculiar,
and
they
wondered
whether
he
had
fled
at
the
first
shot.

Through
the
forest
on
the
right
they
saw
the
outlines
of
several
huts,
and
running
toward
the
castle
were
three
or
four
natives,
evidently
attracted
by
the
revolver
report.
Turning
their
attention
to
themselves
Nattie
and
Mori
found
that
they
were
in
a
peculiar
situation.

Where
they
had
taken
refuge
was
a
spot
behind
the
projecting
stone
frame
of
the
main
entrance.
There
the
drawbridge
extended
out
a
few
feet,
barely
permitting
room
for
two.
There
was
no
way
of
retreating
from
it
save
across
the
bridge
in
plain
view
of
those
in
the
castle.

"Whew!
We
are
nicely
situated,"
remarked
Mori.
"How
are
we
going
to
reach
the
road,
I
wonder?"

"I
guess
we'll
have
to
run
for
it,"
replied
Nattie,
doubtfully.

"Yes,
and
get
potted
before
we
had
gone
three
steps."

"Wait,
I'll
peep
out
and
see
if
they
are
still
on
guard."

Cautiously
edging
his
way
toward
the
center
of
the
bridge,
the
lad
glanced
into
the
interior
of
the
castle.
He
dodged
back
with
great
promptness,
and
said,
with
a
grimace:

"That
bloodthirsty
Irishman
is
standing
near
the
portcullis
with
two
big
revolvers
pointed
this
way."

"Where
are
the
others?"

"I
couldn't
see
them."

Mori
looked
grave.

"They
are
up
to
some
trick,"
he
said.
"I
wonder
if
there
is
any
way
by
which
they
could
leave?"

"Not
without
they
find
a
boat,
or
try
to
swim
the
lake."

"Don't
be
too
sure
of
it.
These
old
_shiros_
sometimes
contain
secret
passages
leading
from
the
interior.
They
could
fool
us
nicely
if
they
should
stumble
across
a
tunnel
running
under
the
moat."

"Confound
it!
we
can't
remain
here
like
two
birds
upon
a
limb,"
exclaimed
Nattie,
impatiently.
"We'll
have
to
make
a
dash
for
it.
Come
on;
I'll
lead."

He
gathered
himself
together
to
dart
across
the
fifteen
feet
of
bridge,
but
before
he
could
start
a
loud
hail
came
from
the
forest
to
the
north
of
the
castle.

Looking
in
that
direction,
they
saw
Sumo
advancing
with
a
whole
host
of
natives.
There
were
at
least
forty
in
the
party,
and
each
appeared
to
be
armed
with
some
sort
of
weapon.
There
were
ancient
guns,
long
spears,
swords,
reaping
hooks
and
a
number
of
plain
clubs.

With
this
martial
array
at
his
heels
the
giant
porter
approached
the
scene,
bearing
himself
like
a
general
at
the
head
of
a
legion.
As
he
walked,
he
flourished
the
sword
given
him
by
Mori,
and
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
orders
to
his
impromptu
command.
At
another
time
it
would
have
been
comical
in
the
extreme,
but
under
the
circumstances,
both
Nattie
and
Mori
hailed
his
appearance
with
joy.

Alas
for
their
hopes!

"Courage,
masters!"
shouted
Sumo.
"Wait
where
you
are.
We
will
drive
the
scoundrels
from
their
stronghold.
March
faster,
my
braves;
get
ready
to
charge."

But
at
that
interesting
moment
the
little
army
arrived
opposite
the
entrance.
"Bang,
bang!"
went
Patrick's
revolvers,
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
whole
forty
natives
took
to
their
heels,
bestrewing
the
road
with
a
choice
collection
of
farming
implements,
ancient
swords
and
clubs.

Sumo
had
discretion
enough
to
drop
behind
a
stump,
from
which
place
of
safety
he
watched
the
flight
of
his
forces
with
feelings
too
harrowing
to
mention.




CHAPTER
XXIX.

A
MYSTERIOUS
DISAPPEARANCE.


Despite
their
position,
Nattie
and
Mori
were
compelled
to
laugh.
And
from
within
came
a
hoarse
burst
of
merriment
that
fairly
shook
the
air.

"Ha,
ha!
ho,
ho!
Look
at
the
monkeys,
will
ye!
Watch
them
run
at
the
sound
of
a
shot.
Worra!
Patrick
Cronin,
did
ye
live
to
see
the
day
when
forty
men
would
scoot
from
the
sight
of
yer
face?"

The
fellow's
taunts
were
cut
short
in
a
manner
unpleasant
to
his
feelings.
While
he
was
dancing
about
inside,
crowing
over
his
victory,
Mori
crept
behind
his
shelter
and
let
drive
with
his
pistol.
The
bullet
cut
a
hole
in
Patrick's
sleeve,
and
sent
him
backward
in
hot
haste.

Seeing
their
advantage,
both
Nattie
and
the
young
Japanese
darted
across
the
drawbridge,
reaching
the
shelter
of
the
forest
without
mishap.
There
they
were
joined
by
Sumo,
who
appeared
thoroughly
discomfited.

"I
thought
they
would
fight,
masters,"
he
explained.
"But
it
seems
they
would
rather
work
in
the
paddy
fields
than
face
firearms.
We
are
not
all
like
that.
If
you
wish,
I
will
face
that
red-bearded
foreigner
myself,
and
I'll
cut
his
comb
for
him,
too."

"That
is
not
necessary,
Sumo,"
replied
Nattie,
with
a
smile.
"We
know
you
are
brave,
but
we
won't
put
you
to
such
a
test.
A
man's
strength
is
as
nothing
before
a
leaden
bullet."

"One
good
thing,"
said
Mori,
"we
are
away
from
that
trap
on
the
drawbridge.
Now
we
must
arrange
to
capture
the
scoundrels.
Sumo,
who
is
a
good
man
to
send
to
the
nearest
town
for
police?"

The
porter
recommended
one
of
the
_karumayas_,
and
the
fellow
was
immediately
dispatched
on
a
run
with
a
written
message
to
the
chief
official
of
the
province.
This
matter
attended
to,
Nattie
and
the
young
Japanese
enlisted
the
services
of
a
part
of
Sumo's
former
forces
and
established
a
line
of
spies
around
the
land
side
of
the
castle.

Several
natives
were
sent
to
a
small
village
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
for
boats,
then
the
two
youthful
commanders
established
themselves
within
hailing
distance
of
the
castle
entrance.
They
could
see
Patrick
pacing
up
and
down,
still
alert.

Nattie
waved
his
white
handkerchief
as
a
flag
of
truce,
and
hailed
him.

"What
do
yez
want?"
growled
the
fellow,
angrily.

"Tell
Ralph
Black
to
come
to
the
door."

"Not
Oi.
Oi'm
no
sarvant
for
the
likes
of
yez."

"But
I
wish
to
speak
with
him,
fool.
It
will
be
to
his
interest,
probably."

"I
am
here,"
suddenly
replied
a
voice,
and
the
merchant's
son
showed
himself
through
the
portcullis.
"What
have
you
to
say,
Nattie
Manning?"

"I
want
to
tell
you
that
you
will
save
time
and
trouble
by
surrendering
my
brother."

"You
don't
say!"
sneered
Ralph.
"And
suppose
we
don't
look
at
it
in
that
light?"

"You
are
a
fool,
that's
all."

"It
is
easy
to
call
names
out
there."

"It
would
be
still
easier
if
I
had
you
here."

"Let
me
explain
matters
a
little,
Ralph,"
spoke
up
Mori,
quietly.
"You
are
in
a
bad
box,
and
you
know
it.
You
and
your
father
have
committed
a
serious
crime
against
the
law
by
abducting
Grant,
and
you
will
suffer
for
it."

"That's
our
lookout,"
was
the
reckless
reply.

"We
have
arranged
matters
so
that
you
cannot
hope
to
escape,"
continued
the
young
Japanese.
"We
have
sent
a
messenger
to
the
authorities,
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
a
force
of
police
will
come
to
our
assistance.
It
will
then
be
an
easy
matter
to
capture
you."

"You
think
so?"

"We
know
it
to
be
so."

"Don't
be
too
sure,
John."

Now,
if
there
is
anything
on
earth
that
will
anger
a
native
of
Japan,
it
is
the
appellation
"John."
It
places
them
on
the
same
level
with
the
Chinamen
in
America,
who
conduct
the
familiar
and
omnipresent
laundry,
and,
look
you,
the
Japanese
rightly
consider
themselves
much
above
their
brother
Asiatics.

Mori
felt
the
insult
keenly,
but
he
was
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
retort
in
kind.
Nattie--hot-tempered,
impulsive
lad--could
not
restrain
himself.

"You
cowardly
brute!"
he
shouted,
shaking
his
fist
at
Ralph.
"I'd
give
half
of
what
I
expect
to
own
on
this
earth
to
have
you
before
me
for
five
minutes."

The
merchant's
son
paled
with
anger,
but
he
discreetly
ignored
the
challenge.

"What
would
you
do,
blowhard?"
he
blustered.
"You
think
yourself
something,
but
I
can
bring
even
you
to
your
knees."

"We
will
see
about
that
when
the
officers
of
the
law
arrive,"
replied
Nattie,
grimly.

"As
I
said
before,
don't
be
too
sure.
I
have
not
played
all
my
cards."

Mori
and
Nattie
exchanged
glances.
What
could
the
fellow
mean?
Ralph
speedily
informed
them.

"Do
you
think
I
would
tamely
submit
to
arrest
and
go
from
here
with
the
certain
knowledge
that
my
destination
would
be
a
long
term
in
a
prison?"
he
snarled.
"Do
you
think
I
am
a
fool?
I
have
a
safeguard
here
in
the
person
of
your
puny,
crippled
brother."

Again
Mori
and
Nattie
asked
themselves
what
the
fellow
meant.
Was
it
possible
he
would
be
villain
enough
to
resort
to
personal
violence.
The
younger
Manning
paled
at
the
very
thought.

"What
would
you
do?"
he
called
out,
and
his
voice
was
unsteady.

Ralph
laughed,
triumphantly.

"I
see
I
have
touched
the
right
spot,"
he
replied.
"I'll
tell
you
in
a
very
few
words.
If
you
do
not
permit
us
to
go
free
from
here
and
give
your
solemn
promise--I
guess
you
had
better
put
it
in
writing--that
you
will
not
molest
us
for
this,
and
also
that
you
will
withdraw
from
the
competition
for
those
army
contracts,
I'll
kill
Grant
Manning
with
my
own
hands."

Nattie
was
very
white
when
the
English
youth
finished.
His
worst
fears
were
realized.
That
Ralph
meant
what
he
said
he
firmly
believed.
Not
so
Mori.

"Don't
pay
any
attention
to
his
threats,"
whispered
the
latter.
"He
is
only
trying
what
you
Americans
call
a
'bluff.'
He
wouldn't
dare
do
any
such
thing.
He
thinks
too
much
of
his
own
neck,
the
precious
scoundrel."

As
if
in
refutation
of
his
opinion,
Ralph
called
out
in
determined
tones:

"I
mean
what
I
say.
I
would
rather
hang
than
live
ten
or
fifteen
years
in
prison.
I
leave
it
to
you.
You
can
take
your
choice.
I
will
give
you
ten
minutes
to
make
up
your
minds,
and
if,
at
the
end
of
that
time,
you
do
not
agree
to
my
terms
it'll
be
the
last
of
your
brother."

"Come
away
where
we
can
talk
without
being
under
the
eye
of
that
miserable
villain,"
said
Mori,
gravely.

"Wait;
I
wish
to
try
a
last
chance,"
replied
Nattie.
He
added
in
a
loud
voice:
"In
the
castle,
there.
Willis
Round,
Cronin,
do
you
intend
to
abide
by
Ralph
Black's
murderous
proposition?"

"That
Oi
do,
and
if
he'd
take
my
advice,
he'd
kill
th'
lot
of
yez,"
instantly
replied
the
Irishman.

The
ex-bookkeeper's
answer
was
longer
in
coming,
and
it
was
not
so
emphatic,
but
it
was
to
the
same
effect.
Nattie
was
turning
away
sadly
when
he
heard
Grant's
familiar
voice
saying,
resolutely:

"Do
not
give
in,
brother.
Wait
for
the
police,
and
you
can
capture
them.
Ralph
won't----"

The
sentence
remained
unfinished.
The
speaker's
captors
had
evidently
interposed
with
effect.
Nattie
and
Mori
walked
sadly
to
the
edge
of
the
forest.
They
left
Sumo
in
front
of
the
entrance
on
watch.

"There
isn't
any
use
talking
about
it,"
said
the
former.
"We
must
agree
to
his
terms.
I
wouldn't
have
a
hair
of
Grant's
head
harmed
for
all
the
contracts
on
earth.
True,
he
may
be
lying,
but
it
is
better
to
run
no
risks.
What
do
you
think
about
it?"

"I
believe
you
are
right.
We
will
permit
them
to
go
free,
but
we'll
wait
until
the
expiration
of
the
time
mentioned.
Perhaps
something
will
turn
up.
I
hate
to
see
that
scoundrel
and
his
mates
crowing
over
us."

"I
have
known
Ralph
Black
a
great
many
years,
but
I
never
thought
he
would
prove
to
be
such
a
thoroughly
heartless
and
desperate
villain.
As
a
boy
he
was
headstrong
and
willful.
He
delighted
in
cruelty
to
animals,
and
was
brutal
to
those
weaker
than
himself,
but
I
little
dreamed
he
would
come
to
this."

"The
boy
was
father
to
the
man,"
replied
Mori,
philosophically.
"He
had
it
in
him
from
birth.
It
is
hereditary;
see
what
his
father
is.
Well,
the
time
is
almost
up,
and
we
might
as
well
go
and
confess
ourselves
beaten.
Ugh!
it
is
a
bitter
pill
to
swallow."

On
rejoining
Sumo
they
found
that
worthy
moving
uneasily
about
in
front
of
the
entrance.
They
saw
also
that
the
space
behind
the
portcullis
was
empty.
The
tramping
of
horses
came
from
within,
but
there
were
no
signs
of
Ralph
or
his
companions.

"Where
in
the
deuce
have
they
gone?"
exclaimed
Nattie,
anxiously.

"I
do
not
know,
excellency,"
replied
the
porter.
"The
funny
man
with
the
fire
hair
and
the
youth
went
away
from
the
door
a
few
minutes
ago.
The
tall,
thin
man,
ran
up
to
them
and
said
something
in
a
voice
full
of
joy,
then
they
all
disappeared."

"Something
is
up,"
exclaimed
Mori,
then
he
hailed
the
castle
in
a
loud
voice.
There
was
no
reply.
Nattie
repeated
the
summons,
but
with
the
same
result.
Now
thoroughly
alarmed,
he
and
the
young
Japanese
advanced
to
the
portcullis
and
beat
upon
it
with
their
weapons.

An
echoing
sound
came
from
the
gloomy
interior,
but
that
was
all.
Sumo
was
instantly
bidden
to
bring
men
with
axes,
and
others
were
sent
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
to
see
if
an
attempt
at
escape
had
been
made.

In
due
time
the
barrier
at
the
entrance
was
broken
away,
and
the
two
lads,
followed
by
their
native
allies,
rushed
past
into
the
ruins.
Over
in
one
corner
of
what
had
been
the
main
yard
were
five
horses
tethered
to
several
posts.
Stores
and
articles
of
clothing
were
scattered
about,
but
of
the
fugitive
party
there
was
no
sign.

A
hasty
search
was
made
of
the
different
apartments;
the
remains
of
the
roof
were
examined;
the
outer
walls
inspected,
but
at
last
Nattie
and
his
companions
were
compelled
to
acknowledge
themselves
baffled.
The
entire
party,
prisoner
and
all,
had
mysteriously
disappeared.




CHAPTER
XXX.

THE
TRAGEDY
IN
THE
TUNNEL.


Greatly
puzzled,
the
lads
searched
the
interior
again
and
again.
Not
a
place
large
enough
to
accommodate
even
a
dog
was
omitted.
The
towers
were
mere
shells,
with
here
and
there
a
huge
beam
of
wood,
all
that
was
left
of
the
different
floors.

A
door
opening
upon
the
lake
was
found,
but
it
had
been
impassable
for
years.
Masses
of
_débris_,
encumbering
the
castle,
were
moved
about,
but
nothing
was
discovered
until
finally
the
giant,
Sumo,
while
delving
into
the
darkest
corner
of
the
most
remote
apartment,
suddenly
stepped
into
a
hole,
and
narrowly
saved
himself
by
grasping
at
the
edge.

His
cries
brought
the
whole
party
helter-skelter
into
the
room.
A
torch
of
resinous
pine
was
lighted,
and
the
mystery
revealed.
The
hole
was
the
jagged
entrance
to
a
tunnel,
the
bottom
of
which
was
dimly
visible
in
the
rays
cast
by
the
flickering
light.

"It
is
a
secret
exit
from
the
castle,"
cried
Nattie.
"Quick!
bring
other
torches;
we
must
follow
at
once."

"I
thought
we
would
find
something
of
the
kind,"
remarked
Mori,
no
less
excited.
"All
these
old
_shiros_
have
such
outlets.
It
is
fortunate
we
have
found
this
so
easily.
The
other
party
cannot
be
very
far
in
advance."

There
was
much
running
about,
but
finally
a
start
was
made
with
an
ample
supply
of
torches.
Sumo
was
the
only
native
that
could
be
induced
to
accompany
the
lads,
the
others
hanging
back
in
superstitious
terror.

Word
was
left
with
one
of
the
_'rikisha_
men
to
hold
the
police
at
the
castle
until
word
arrived,
then
Nattie
and
Mori
eagerly
descended
into
the
cavity,
Sumo
bringing
up
the
rear
with
the
sticks
of
pine
and
his
ancient
sword.

A
few
crumbling
steps
led
to
the
bottom,
which
was
about
twelve
or
thirteen
feet
from
the
floor.
A
little
heap
of
dust
at
the
lower
level
bore
the
imprints
of
several
feet.
It
was
proof
enough
that
the
fugitives
had
entered
the
tunnel.

A
couple
of
yards
from
the
entrance
the
excavation
made
a
sharp
descent.
The
floor
was
thick
with
slime,
and
moisture
dripped
from
overhead.
The
tunnel
became
smaller
and
smaller
and
traces
of
masonry
were
found.

"We
are
passing
under
the
moat,"
said
Mori,
elevating
his
torch.
"Ugh!
what
a
dreadful
place
this
is."

Nattie
made
no
reply.
He
walked
ahead
steadily,
and
ever
kept
his
eyes
in
advance,
as
if
eager
to
catch
sight
of
the
fugitives.
Huge
rats
peered
at
the
party
from
sheltered
nooks,
or
darted
across
their
path,
as
if
careless
of
molestation.
The
silence
was
intense;
the
solitude
painful.

Presently
the
air
became
foul.
It
was
thick
and
heavy
with
an
odor
like
that
of
a
tomb.
On
turning
a
corner
they
suddenly
came
upon
a
row
of
human
skeletons
stretched
out
in
an
orderly
manner
upon
the
floor.
It
was
a
ghastly
spectacle,
and
brought
a
terrified
cry
from
Sumo.
He
stopped
and
appeared
unwilling
to
cross
the
bones.

"Come
on,
or
remain
alone,"
said
Nattie,
grimly.

The
giant
porter
promptly
followed
them,
but
his
huge
frame
shook
with
superstitious
fear.
At
the
end
of
five
minutes,
a
brief
halt
was
made.
The
tunnel
was
filled
with
a
dark,
moldy
air,
difficult
to
breathe.
Gasping
and
coughing,
Mori
turned
an
inquiring
eye
to
his
friend.

"We
must
not
turn
back,"
replied
the
lad.
"They
passed
through
here,
and
we
can
also.
Come;
we
are
losing
time.
See,
the
torches
are
burning
out.
If
we
do
not
hasten
we
will
be
left
in
darkness."

The
very
possibility
of
such
a
dread
occurrence
sent
the
trio
on
almost
at
a
run.
To
be
left
in
darkness
in
the
tunnel,
with
its
ghastly
tenants,
was
terrifying
to
contemplate.
Sumo
magnified
the
horrors
a
hundredfold
through
his
ignorance,
and
his
plight
was
pitiful
to
see.

On,
on;
the
torches
flickering;
grotesque
shadows
surrounding
them;
the
atmosphere
becoming
more
dank
and
difficult
to
breathe
with
each
passing
moment.
Huge
rodents
pattering
before,
their
sharp,
piercing
eyes
gleaming
like
the
optics
of
fleeing
demons;
a
dripping
of
water
here
and
puddles
of
foul
scum
there.

Only
one
thing
strengthened
the
little
party
as
they
sped
along,
and
that
was
the
knowledge
that
other
humans
had
passed
through
the
same
horrors
but
a
few
brief
moments
before.

"How
much
farther?"
gasped
Mori,
for
the
tenth
time.

"How
much
farther?"
echoed
Sumo,
with
a
groan.

"Heart
up,"
replied
Nattie,
redoubling
his
speed.
"We
must
be
almost
there.
Don't
give
up.
Remember
Ralph
and
the
others
took
the
same
journey.
Are
they
more
brave
than
we?"

"You
are
right,
my
boy.
We
must
persist;
the
end
cannot
be
far
away."

They
had
already
traveled
a
distance
at
least
equal
to
two
city
blocks.
The
tunnel
had
made
various
turns,
but
as
yet
they
had
not
encountered
any
side
excavations.
This
was
fortunate,
as
it
permitted
them
to
continue
ahead
without
any
doubt
as
to
the
proper
passage.

Presently,
to
the
unspeakable
delight
of
all
three,
the
air
became
less
foul.

"We
are
almost
there,"
cried
Nattie,
cheerily.
"Courage,
courage!"

It
was
time.
The
torches,
mere
pine
slivers,
had
burned
away
until
only
a
few
inches
remained.
They
had
started
with
an
ample
supply,
but
while
passing
the
ghastly
array
of
skeletons,
Sumo
had
dropped
the
reserve
bundle
in
his
terror.

Suddenly
the
one
carried
by
Mori
gave
out;
then
Nattie's
gave
a
feeble
splutter
and
expired.
Presently,
however,
the
floor
in
the
tunnel
began
to
brighten,
and
finally,
on
turning
a
corner,
a
feeble
speck
of
light
became
perceptible
in
the
distance.

"The
end,
thank
God!"
shouted
Mori.

The
echoes
of
his
voice
had
hardly
died
away
when
a
most
dreadful
thing
happened.
Without
the
slightest
warning
to
herald
its
approach
there
came
a
terrific
rending
shock.
It
seemed
as
if
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
had
collapsed
in
one
great
crash.

Nattie
and
Mori
and
Sumo
were
thrown
to
the
ground
with
violent
force,
and
there
they
lay
mercifully
deprived
of
consciousness,
while
around
them
the
walls
and
roof
and
floor
of
the
tunnel
heaved
and
pitched
in
the
throes
of
an
earthquake.

The
disturbance
only
lasted
a
moment,
but
it
was
some
time
before
the
little
party
recovered.
Nattie
was
the
first
to
stagger
to
his
feet.
The
torch
had
gone
out,
leaving
an
impenetrable
darkness.
The
welcoming
light--the
light
proclaiming
the
exit
from
the
tunnel--had
disappeared.

The
lad
was
bewildered,
almost
daft,
and
small
wonder.
He
lurched
about
until
at
last
he
stumbled
and
fell
across
Mori.
The
shock
brought
the
young
Japanese
to
his
senses.
Then
Sumo
scrambled
to
his
feet.

Panic-stricken,
they
started
to
run.
Slipping,
staggering,
sorely
bruising
themselves
against
the
sides
of
the
passage,
they
fled
in
overwhelming
terror.
A
yard,
ten
yards,
a
hundred
yards,
and
then
they
brought
up
with
a
crash
against
an
impenetrable
barrier
of
rock
and
earth.

The
exit
was
closed!




CHAPTER
XXXI.

RALPH
SECURES
REINFORCEMENTS.


"The
exit
is
closed!"

The
cry
came
simultaneously
from
all
three.
Shrill
and
with
a
terrible
weight
of
despair
it
echoed
through
the
tunnel.
Then
came
a
weird
crooning.
It
was
the
death-song
of
Sumo's
people.

Mori
stopped
him
with
a
fierce
command,
saying,
harshly:

"Silence,
dog!
Would
you
add
to
our
misery?
Silence,
I
say!"

The
result
of
civilization
now
became
apparent.
The
first
natural
feeling
of
terror
passed,
the
reaction
came,
and
both
Nattie
and
the
young
Japanese
were
able
to
discuss
their
situation
with
more
or
less
calmness.

"This
is
dreadful,
simply
dreadful,"
said
the
latter;
"but
we
must
face
it
and
see
what
can
be
done
to
save
ourselves."

"What
was
it,
an
earthquake?"

"Yes,
but
not
much
of
a
shock.
We
felt
it
down
here;
above
ground
it
was
simply
a
wave
of
minor
strength."

"But
others
may
come,
masters,"
exclaimed
the
porter,
with
chattering
teeth.

"You
are
right.
We
must
hasten
back
the
way
we
came.
The
shock
has
barred
our
passage
in
this
direction;
only
the
castle
exit
remains
to
us."

There
was
little
time
lost
in
commencing
the
retreat.
Grasping
hands
the
three
staggered
along
the
tunnel
floor,
walking,
running,
and
even
crawling
at
times.
The
dust
that
had
filled
the
excavation
immediately
after
the
earthquake
soon
settled,
and
the
breathing
became
easier.

Presently
Nattie
stopped.

"What
is
the
matter?"
anxiously
asked
Mori.

"Grant--what
of
him?"
replied
the
lad,
pitifully.
"Do
you
think
they
succeeded
in
leaving
before
the
shock
came?"

"Undoubtedly.
We
saw
the
exit,
and
had
almost
gained
it.
They
had
at
least
ten
minutes'
start.
Don't
worry;
Grant
is
safe."

Reassured,
Nattie
resumed
the
flight
with
his
companions.
In
due
time
they
came
to
the
crypt
occupied
by
the
skeletons,
but
Sumo
never
faltered.
That
terror
had
paled
before
a
greater.

A
foreboding
that
another
barrier
might
be
encountered
brought
a
pallor
to
the
cheeks
of
the
fugitives.
The
fear
was
fortunately
without
foundation.
The
passage
remained
clear,
and
in
due
course
of
time
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
castle
floor.

Weary,
worn
out,
their
clothing
disordered
and
torn,
and
with
the
fear
of
death
still
lingering
in
their
faces,
the
three
painfully
scrambled
into
the
air
and
flung
themselves,
gasping
for
breath,
upon
the
stone
pavement
of
the
inner
yard
of
the
_shiro_.

The
place
was
deserted.
The
coolies
and
_'rikisha_
men
had
evidently
fled
at
the
first
signs
of
the
earthquake.
Presently
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
from
the
outside
indicated
that
they
were
still
within
easy
call.

After
a
brief
moment
of
rest
Nattie
staggered
to
his
feet,
and,
followed
by
his
companions,
emerged
upon
the
drawbridge.
Their
appearance
was
received
with
shouts
of
astonishment
and
awe.
To
the
superstitious
eyes
of
the
natives,
they
were
as
beings
of
another
world.

That
any
mortal
could
survive
the
clutches
of
the
_jishin_,
or
earthquake,
while
in
its
domains
underground
was
not
possible.
With
one
accord
the
terrified
natives
fled
for
the
forest.

They
were
speedily
brought
to
a
halt
by
Mori,
who
was
in
no
mood
for
foolishness.
Rushing
after
them,
he
grasped
the
nearest
and
fiercely
ordered
him
to
bring
food
and
_sake_,
the
mild
wine
of
the
country.

"Fools;
what
think
you?"
he
exclaimed.
"We
are
not
ghosts.
We
have
escaped
from
the
tunnel
through
the
aid
of
a
merciful
Providence.
We
are
exhausted,
and
require
meat
and
drink."

With
many
ejaculations
of
awe
and
amazement
the
_karumayas_
obeyed.
Before
eating,
Mori,
Nattie
and
Sumo
removed
the
tattered
remnants
of
their
clothing,
and
bathed
themselves
in
the
cool
waters
of
the
lake.
Then
a
few
mouthfuls
of
food
were
taken.

The
wine
put
new
life
in
the
lads.
Refreshed
and
invigorated,
they
prepared
for
the
pursuit.
It
was
decided
without
caution
that
the
caves
must
be
reached
without
delay.

"I
am
positive
it
is
their
destination,"
said
Nattie.

"Undoubtedly.
We
will
follow
the
scoundrels
with
the
aid
of
their
own
horses.
Sumo,
you
and
two
others
come
with
us.
The
rest
can
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
police.
Forward!"

After
the
party
had
ridden
a
short
distance,
Mori
was
seen
to
cast
many
anxious
glances
toward
the
mighty
peak
of
Bandai-San.
It
was
in
plain
view,
apparently
on
the
other
shore
of
the
lake,
and
its
sloping
reaches
spoke
eloquently
of
the
ages
in
which
the
flow
of
molten
lava
had
created
the
majestic
mountain.

"What
is
the
matter?"
asked
Nattie.

"I
don't
like
the
looks
of
the
old
fellow
this
morning,"
replied
the
young
Japanese.
"Do
you
see
that
misty
vapor
hovering
over
the
summit.
That
means
activity
of
the
volcano.
Mark
my
words,
it
is
on
the
eve
of
an
eruption."

"Yes,
Bandai-San
is
awaking
from
his
long
sleep,"
put
in
Sumo.

"That
earthquake
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
it,"
said
Nattie.

"No
doubt.
It
may
be
the
forerunner
of
a
strong
disturbance."

As
they
rode
on,
the
curious
cloud
became
more
pronounced.
Fearing
the
recurrence
of
a
shock,
the
party
avoided
the
shelter
of
trees,
and
kept
to
the
open
as
much
as
possible.

After
leaving
the
neighborhood
of
the
lake
a
road
was
encountered,
so
bad
that
it
was
necessary
to
walk
the
horses.
At
last
it
degenerated
into
a
mere
path
among
the
narrow
paddy
fields.
A
collection
of
rude
huts
hardly
numerous
enough
to
deserve
the
title
of
village
was
reached
after
a
while.

Singularly
enough,
there
were
no
inhabitants
visible.
Not
the
slightest
signs
of
life
could
be
seen
save
the
still
smoking
embers
of
a
fire
outside
of
one
of
the
houses.
This
apparent
air
of
desertion
was
rendered
all
the
more
strange
because
of
the
intense
interest
generally
created
among
the
natives
by
the
cavalcade.

"Find
out
what
is
the
matter,
Sumo,"
directed
Mori.

The
giant
cantered
up
to
one
of
the
huts
and
rapped
lustily
upon
the
wall
with
his
sword.
Presently
a
head
was
thrust
through
a
hole
in
the
thatch,
but
it
immediately
disappeared
on
seeing
the
warlike
porter.

"Come
out
of
that,"
Sumo
shouted,
authoritatively.
"Give
my
masters
some
information,
or
I'll
burn
your
hut
about
your
ears.
Out,
I
say!"

There
was
a
moment
of
delay,
then
a
shrinking,
half-clad
Japanese
coolie
crept
from
the
door
and
cast
himself
at
Sumo's
feet.
He
was
evidently
greatly
terrified.
He
wailed
aloud,
and
refused
to
raise
his
head
from
the
dust.
Impatient
at
the
delay,
Mori
and
Nattie
rode
up
and
commanded
the
wretch
to
speak.

"Did
a
party
composed
of
foreigners
and
several
coolies
with
a
prisoner
pass
through
here
recently?"
asked
the
former.

"Yes,
excellency,"
stammered
the
man.
"There
were
seven
in
all.
They
stopped
here,
and
compelled
twenty
of
our
best
men
to
accompany
them.
They
made
them
carry
reaping-hooks
and
almost
all
the
provisions
in
town.
They
took
my
store
of
rice
for
the
winter."

"Whew!
Ralph
intends
to
prepare
for
a
siege,"
exclaimed
Nattie.
"What
a
fool
he
is!
Men
and
provisions,
eh?
What
can
he
hope
to
do
against
the
authorities?"

"Did
they
state
their
destination?"
Mori
asked
the
native.

"No,
but
they
went
in
that
direction,"
he
replied,
pointing
beyond
Bandai-San.

"That's
the
way
to
the
caves,"
muttered
Nattie,
then
he
added,
aloud:
"How
long
have
they
been
gone?"

"Not
twenty
minutes,
excellency.
Look!
you
can
see
the
dust
still
lingering
above
the
bushes
upon
that
hill.
They
are
not
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
yet."

After
tossing
the
man
a
couple
of
_yen_,
to
repay
him
for
the
loss
of
his
rice,
Nattie
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
led
the
way
up
the
path.
Presently
the
party
reached
a
species
of
tableland,
near
the
summit
of
an
almost
inaccessible
hill
which
rose
near
the
base
of
the
volcano.




CHAPTER
XXXII.

THE
FLASHING
OF
THE
SWORDS.


The
spot
seemed
wild
and
desolate,
there
being
no
evidence
of
cultivation
or
of
human
habitation.
On
one
side
extended
numerous
deep
ravines,
which
gave
an
air
of
solemnity
to
the
scene.
The
narrow,
seldom-used
path
turned
sharply
to
the
left
in
a
direction
away
from
their
destination.

A
halt
was
called
upon
a
natural
platform
overgrown
with
brambles.
Sumo,
who
had
some
knowledge
of
woodcraft,
leaped
from
his
horse
and
examined
the
brush.

"They
have
passed
here,
masters,"
he
announced.
"I
find
little
threads
hanging
to
the
thorns;
and
the
grass
is
trampled
in
places."

"We
must
proceed
with
caution,"
said
Mori,
restraining
Nattie,
who
had
already
started.
"Remember,
Ralph
has
a
number
of
men
with
him,
and
he
is
liable
to
ambuscade
us."

"I
will
go
on
ahead,"
volunteered
the
giant
porter,
swinging
his
massive
sword
vindictively.
"You
follow
slowly.
If
I
see
anything
I
will
make
the
sound
of
a
wild
crow."

"Don't
lose
any
time
in
your
scouting,"
said
Nattie,
impatiently.
"Confound
them,
they'll
get
away
from
us
yet."

Leaving
his
horse
in
charge
of
one
of
the
coolies,
Sumo
slipped
through
the
brush
and
disappeared
down
one
of
the
ravines.
After
looking
to
their
weapons,
the
rest
silently
followed.
They
had
barely
traveled
a
hundred
yards
when
the
harsh
cry
of
a
wild
crow
came
to
their
ears;
then
before
the
echoes
had
died
away,
the
fierce
clashing
of
steel
thrilled
the
air.

"He
has
been
attacked,"
shouted
Nattie,
putting
his
horse
to
the
bushes.
"Quick,
we
have
them
now!"

With
the
rest
at
his
back,
he
dashed
down
a
gentle
slope
into
the
head
of
the
ravine.
Passing
a
large
clump
of
trees
they
came
upon
a
most
thrilling
scene.
Two
hundred
yards
from
the
hill
the
valley
narrowed
to
a
space
not
wider
than
a
city
sidewalk.

The
"gut"
was
formed
by
a
huge
mass
of
earth,
which
had
fallen
from
the
heights
overhead.
The
bottom
was
evidently
the
dry
bed
of
a
mountain
stream,
and
innumerable
bowlders
and
jagged
pieces
of
flint
were
scattered
here
and
there,
rendering
walking
difficult.

The
scenery
was
an
afterthought.
That
which
instantly
attracted
the
attention
of
Nattie
and
Mori
was
the
figure
of
a
native
almost
as
large
as
Sumo
standing
at
the
beginning
of
the
narrow
passage.
The
fellow
was
armed
with
a
sword,
which
he
shook
vindictively
at
the
party.

Several
feet
away
stood
the
giant
porter,
calmly
whetting
the
huge
weapon
given
him
by
Mori.
Farther
up
the
ravine
stood
the
Irishman,
Patrick
Cronin.
The
man
grinned
impudently
on
seeing
the
newcomers,
then
he
turned
and
disappeared
behind
a
mass
of
underbrush.

"After
him!'
shouted
Nattie,
riding
headlong
into
the
valley.

"Hold!"

The
abrupt
warning
came
from
Sumo.
He
had
strode
in
the
way
with
one
hand
raised.

"What
do
you
mean?"
demanded
Mori.
And
as
he
spoke
he
leveled
his
revolver
at
the
challenging
figure
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
"gut."

"Don't
shoot
him,
excellency,"
exclaimed
Sumo,
imploringly.
"That
is
Raiko,
the
thug.
I
knew
him
in
Yokohama.
He
did
me
an
injury
once.
Now,
I
claim
satisfaction."

"What
nonsense
is
this?"
shouted
Nattie.
"Would
you
delay
us,
man?"

"It
will
not
take
long,"
replied
Sumo,
with
a
scowl
directed
toward
Raiko.
"I'll
promise
you
his
head
in
the
song
of
a
stork.
See!
I
commence."

He
sprang
forward,
and
with
great
agility
threw
himself
upon
Raiko.
The
latter
uttered
a
shrill
cry,
seemingly
of
exultation
and
defiance,
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
ancient
enemies
were
engaged
in
what
evidently
promised
to
be
mortal
combat.

Human
nature
is
not
proof
against
the
thrill
and
excitement
of
war.
Much
as
we
deplore
fighting,
there
is
something
in
the
clash
of
arms
that
fascinates
us.
From
the
glorious
spectacle
of
marshaled
armies
to
the
duel
between
individuals,
there
is
a
charm
not
to
be
resisted
by
mankind
of
any
degree.

Nattie
and
Mori
were
not
different
in
that
respect
from
other
lads.
They
were
both
truthful,
honest,
manly
boys,
with
a
just
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong,
but
deep
down
in
their
hearts
was
a
little
of
the
old
leaven
with
which
we
are
still
afflicted
more
or
less.

For
the
moment
they
forgot
their
quest
and
watched
the
fight
with
eager
eyes.
The
two
combatants
were
equally
matched.
If
anything,
Sumo
was
slightly
taller,
but
Raiko
made
up
for
the
discrepancy
in
a
greater
breadth
of
shoulders.

Both
were
armed
with
the
heavy
two-edged
sword
formerly
used
by
the
ancient
_daimios_,
and
they
were
fairly
skilled
in
the
practice.
Raiko
had
the
advantage
in
position.
Where
he
had
taken
his
stand
was
a
spot
elevated
a
foot
or
more
above
the
rest
of
the
ravine.
Sumo,
however,
had
greater
room
in
which
to
swing
his
weapon,
and
in
case
of
pressure
he
had
the
ravine
at
his
back.

At
the
first
onslaught
the
play
was
furious,
and
the
rocks
rang
with
the
clash
of
steel.
Cut,
slash,
went
the
swords.
Backward
and
forward
sprang
the
antagonists.
Now
to
the
right,
now
to
the
left,
dodging,
leaping,
advancing,
and
retreating.

In
the
midst
of
it
all
came
the
hissing
murmur
of
strained
voices.
Tongues
were
going
as
well
as
arms--words
keen
with
venom;
phrases
sharpened
with
hate
played
their
part
in
the
fierce
duel.

Presently
the
fury
of
the
combat
had
slackened.
Nature
was
calling
a
halt.
Of
the
two,
Raiko
had
suffered
the
most.
He
was
bleeding
in
a
dozen
places.
But
Sumo
had
not
entirely
escaped.
A
broad,
raw
wound
on
his
right
thigh
showed
where
his
antagonist's
sword
had
tasted
blood.

Like
two
bucks
weary
with
strife,
the
twain
backed
away
from
one
another
and,
leaning
upon
their
weapons,
glared
with
unabated
hatred.
The
respite
was
momentary.
Ere
Nattie
and
Mori
could
speak
they
were
at
it
again.

"Dog!
Robber
of
the
lame!"
shouted
Sumo,
aiming
a
shrewd
blow
at
his
enemy.
"Your
career
is
ended.
Now
for
a
taste
of
revenge.
Remember
the
night
at
the
_matsura_?
Remember
the
cowardly
thrust
thou
gavest
my
brother?"

"Yes;
and
I
have
one
such
for
thee,
worm!"
retorted
Raiko.
"Thou
bulk
of
nothingness,
I'll
send
thee
to
the
offal
heap
to-day,
and--ugh!
ugh!"

With
a
harsh
cry,
almost
inhuman
in
its
intensity,
he
fell
against
the
side
of
the
ravine,
sent
there
by
a
terrible
downward
blow
from
Sumo's
triumphant
sword.
Leaping
upon
his
prostrate
enemy,
the
giant
porter
gave
a
sweep
of
the
weapon,
then
he
stood
erect
with
Raiko's
gory
head
in
his
grasp!




CHAPTER
XXXIII.

"GRANT!
BROTHER,
IS
IT
YOU?"


The
scene
was
tragic.
A
ray
from
the
afternoon
sun
glinted
down
through
a
rift
in
the
foliage,
bringing
out
in
bold
relief
the
warrior
figure
of
the
giant.
Thus
he
stood
for
a
moment,
evidently
tasting
his
triumph
to
the
full,
then,
with
a
contemptuous
laugh,
he
tossed
the
head
of
his
fallen
foe
upon
the
prostrate
trunk.

"Send
me
to
the
offal
heap,
thou
braggart?"
he
exclaimed.
"Where
art
thou
now,
Raiko?
It
was
a
lie
to
be
answered
with
the
rest
of
thy
sins
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
of
Buddha.
Poof!
that
was
an
easy
fight.
Now
I
try
conclusions
with
the
fiery-bearded
foreigner."

Turning,
he
sped
up
the
ravine
and
vanished
from
sight,
leaving
Nattie
and
Mori
eying
one
another
in
astonishment.

"What
a
bloodthirsty
wretch
it
is!"
said
the
latter.

"Civilization
is
merely
skin
deep
in
some,"
dryly
replied
his
companion.
"This
is
a
sorry
spectacle
even
in
the
interior
of
your
country.
Don't
you
think
we
should
feel
ashamed?"

"I
don't
know
but
that
you
are
right,"
was
the
naïve
reply.
"But,
confound
it
all,
Nattie,
Sumo
had
great
provocation,
and,
remember,
he
fought
in
our
interests."

"Then
we
will
forgive
him.
I'll
harbor
a
little
contempt
for
myself
for
some
time,
though.
Let
somebody
bury
the
body,
or
take
it
to
the
nearest
village.
Come;
we
have
lost
too
much
time
as
it
is."

"Sumo
is
as
rash
as
he
is
brave,"
remarked
Mori,
as
he
rode
along
at
his
friend's
side.
"If
he
don't
watch
out,
Patrick
will
nab
him."

While
trotting
across
a
rocky
shelf,
Nattie
chanced
to
look
up
toward
the
cone
of
the
nearby
volcano.
To
his
surprise,
he
saw
that
the
vapory
mist
had
given
way
to
a
dense
volume
of
pitch-black
smoke.
Little
tongues
of
flame
shot
athwart
the
column
at
intervals,
and
hovering
over
the
summit
was
a
cloud
of
ashes
glinting
dully
in
the
sun.

"That
looks
threatening,"
he
exclaimed,
calling
Mori's
attention
to
it.

"By
Jove,
Bandai-San
is
in
eruption,"
was
the
instant
reply.
"It
is
the
first
time
in
my
memory,
too."
Then
he
added,
gravely:
"Nattie,
this
comes
at
a
bad
time."
"Why?"

"If
there
should
be
a
flow
of
lava--which
is
highly
probable--our
stay
in
this
neighborhood
will
be
dangerous."

"Does
it
ever
reach
this
far?"

"No;
but
we
must
pass
near
the
base
of
the
mountain
on
our
way
to
the
caves."

"And
the
other
party?"

"They
will
be
placed
in
peril
also."

"Then
we
must
catch
them
before
they
reach
there,"
exclaimed
Nattie,
urging
his
horse
forward.
"I
don't
care
a
snap
for
Ralph
or
his
crew,
but
Grant----"

"Sh-h-h!
Some
one
is
coming
down
the
ravine."

A
dull
noise,
like
the
scrambling
of
naked
feet
over
the
gravel
and
rocky
soil
of
the
dry
river
bed,
came
to
their
ears.
It
increased
until
at
last
it
became
evident
that
a
considerable
body
of
men
were
approaching.

"Quick!
out
of
the
way!"
exclaimed
Nattie,
turning
sharply
to
the
right.

Reining
in
his
steed
behind
an
overhanging
mass
of
earth,
he
drew
his
revolver
and
waited
in
silence.

Mori
soon
joined
him.
They
had
barely
concealed
themselves
when
a
score
of
half-naked
natives
dashed
past,
uttering
cries
of
alarm
as
they
ran.

They
were
apparently
wild
with
terror.
The
cause
was
speedily
explained.
While
hurrying
down
the
ravine
more
than
one
would
pause
and
cast
fearful
glances
toward
the
smoking
crater
of
old
Bandai-San.
The
impending
eruption
was
the
secret
of
their
flight.

"It
is
the
body
of
villagers
taken
away
by
Ralph,"
said
Mori.
"Their
terror
of
the
volcano
has
proved
stronger
than
their
fear
of
the
foreigners.
Good!
I
am
glad
they
have
abandoned
him.
Now
he
won't
have
such
an
overwhelming
force."

"Did
you
notice
whether
the
two
other
coolies
were
with
them?
I
mean
those
who
were
with
Ralph
at
the
castle?"

"I
think
I
did
see
one.
Humph!
you
can
rest
assured
that
very
few
natives
will
remain
in
the
neighborhood
when
a
volcano
is
spouting
fire.
I
even
wonder
that
Sumo----"

As
if
the
name
carried
the
magic
power
of
conjuring,
it
was
barely
uttered
when
the
bushes
on
the
left
slope
of
the
ravine
parted
and
the
giant
porter
strode
into
view.

"Hail,
masters,"
he
said,
stopping
and
wiping
his
perspiring
face.

"Where
have
you
been?
What
have
you
seen?"
asked
Nattie
and
Mori,
in
a
breath.

"I
was
in
chase
of
the
devil
with
the
red
beard."

"Did
you
see
him?"

Sumo
laughed
grimly.

"Yes,
as
the
hunter
sees
the
hawk
in
its
flight,"
he
replied.
"Red-beard
is
swift
in
his
pace
when
danger
threatens."

"Did
you
see
the
others?"
eagerly
asked
Nattie.

"No,
but
I
followed
them
close
to
the
mud
caves.
Poof!
they
are
fools.
Know
they
not
that
the
demon
of
the
mountain,
old
'Jishin'
himself,
lives
there?
And
now
is
his
hunting
time.
See!
Bandai-San
is
angry.
He
sends
forth
fire
and
smoke.
Presently
the
river
that
runs
molten
red
will
flow
down
the
mountainside."

"Are
you
afraid?"
rather
contemptuously
asked
Nattie.

"Not
of
mortal,
master;
but
it
is
no
shame
to
bow
to
the
wrath
of
the
gods.
Whither
go
you?"

"In
search
of
my
brother,"
was
the
terse
reply,
and
the
lad
set
spurs
to
his
horse.

"You
shall
not
go
alone,"
spoke
up
Mori,
riding
after
him.

Sumo
glanced
after
their
retreating
forms,
then
he
cast
his
eyes
upward
to
where
the
smoke
over
the
crater
was
assuming
a
ruddy
tinge.
It
was
enough.
Tossing
up
his
arms,
he
started
off
at
a
long
trot
and
vanished
over
the
bit
of
tableland
at
the
head
of
the
ravine.
His
superstitious
fears
had
proved
the
victor.

"Mori,
you
are
a
friend
indeed,"
said
Nattie,
when
the
young
Japanese
rejoined
him.
"But
I
cannot
permit
you
to
run
unnecessary
risks
for
our
sake.
Return
while
you
have
the
chance."

"Not
much,"
was
the
hearty
reply.
"Where
you
go
I
go.
You
insult
me.
Do
you
think
I
would
leave
you
and
Grant
in
the
lurch?
Not
if
ten
thousand
volcanoes
were
to
erupt.
Tut!
tut!
that
will
do.
Not
another
word."

"I
will
say
this,
old
fellow,"
gratefully.
"You
will
never
regret
your
actions
on
this
trip.
We
will
find
some
way
to
repay
you."

On
up
the
valley
rode
the
two
friends,
side
by
side.
Presently
a
place
was
reached
where
it
became
necessary
to
leave
the
horses
and
continue
on
foot.
Shortly
after
they
had
dismounted
there
came
a
deep
rumbling
noise
and
the
earth
trembled
beneath
their
feet.

Pale
but
resolute,
they
strode
along.
There
was
a
smell
of
sulphur
in
the
air;
the
leaves
of
the
scrubby
trees
were
coated
with
impalpable
gray
ashes,
and
a
sifting
cloud
of
powdery
fragments
fell
upon
them.

Suddenly,
while
passing
around
an
abrupt
bend
in
the
ravine,
they
saw
ahead
of
them
the
figure
of
a
youth
limping
in
their
direction.
Nattie
gave
the
newcomer
one
startled
glance,
then
he
rushed
forward,
crying:

"Grant!
Brother,
is
it
you?"




CHAPTER
XXXIV.

THE
MYSTERIOUS
FORCES
OF
NATURE.


It
was
Grant.
Hobbling
along
as
fast
as
his
crippled
limbs
could
carry
him,
he
threw
himself
into
his
brother's
arms,
and
for
a
moment
they
forgot
all
else
in
the
emotion
of
their
greeting.
Then
Mori
came
in
for
his
well-earned
share.

The
amount
of
handshaking
and
incoherent
expressions
that
followed
was
wonderful.
Mutual
explanations
were
demanded
and
given
with
hearty
good
will.
The
lame
youth
told
briefly
his
experiences
on
board
the
junk,
then
he
added:

"After
we
left
that
dreadful
tunnel
running
from
the
castle
I
almost
gave
up
hope.
I
felt
instinctively
that
you
were
underground
when
that
first
earthquake
shock
came,
and
I
was
awfully
worried."

"We
escaped,
as
you
can
see,"
said
Nattie,
with
a
happy
grin.

"If
not
you
are
pretty
lively
ghosts,"
said
Grant,
in
the
same
vein;
then
he
continued:
"That
brute
Ralph
hurried
us
along
the
mountain
for
a
while.
Then
we
stopped
at
a
village
and
compelled
some
of
the
poor
natives
to
accompany
us.
I
tell
you,
Ralph
Black
must
be
crazy.
None
but
a
lunatic
would
hope
to
escape
from
the
law
for
such
an
outrage.
Fancy
him
thinking
he
could
take
me
to
a
cave
in
the
mountain
and
keep
off
the
lawful
forces
of
the
country."

"It
is
past
belief,"
remarked
Mori.
"But
tell
us,
how
did
you
manage
to
escape?"

"I
am
coming
to
that.
But
hadn't
we
better
leave
this
neighborhood?
Ralph
and
Patrick
are
liable
to
follow
me
at
any
moment."

"Where
is
Willis
Round?"
quickly
asked
Nattie,
noting
the
omission
of
the
bookkeeper's
name.

Grant
smiled.

"We
needn't
fear
anything
from
him,"
he
said.

"Is
he
dead?"

"No;
he
helped
me
to
escape."

"What!"

"It
is
a
fact.
Wait;
I'll
tell
you.
After
we
arrived
in
the
vicinity
of
the
caves--which
are
dreadful
places,
by
the
way--Round
slipped
up
to
me
and
began
to
talk
about
matters
in
general.
Before
he
had
said
many
words
I
saw
his
object.
He
was
trying
to
'hedge,'
as
they
call
it
in
racing
parlance."

"To
crawl
out
of
the
scrape,
eh?"

"Yes;
I
led
him
on,
and
he
presently
asked
me
point-blank
if
I
would
promise
to
save
him
from
punishment
if
he
should
help
me
to
escape.
I
replied
that
I
would
do
what
I
could
for
him,
but
I
would
promise
nothing.
He
was
content
with
that,
and
after
a
while
he
succeeded
in
cutting
the
thongs
binding
my
hands.

"Shortly
after,
while
we
were
hurrying
through
a
dense
copse
I
slipped
behind
and
ran
as
fast
as
I
could
on
the
back
trail.
It
was
a
risky
piece
of
business,
as
Ralph
had
threatened
to
shoot
me
if
I
made
another
attempt
to
escape."

"And
the
villain
would
do
it,
too,"
said
Nattie.

"I
believe
he
would.
The
boy
is
crazy--clean
stark
crazy.
None
but
a
lunatic
would
do
as
he
has
done."

"They
must
see
their
mistake
now,"
remarked
Mori,
grimly.

"They
do.
Willis
Round
is
nearly
frightened
to
death.
Patrick
still
remains
obstinate
and
advises
a
general
slaughter
of
all,
but
I
think
he
is
weakening.
The
natives
they
took
from
the
village
deserted
on
account
of
the
threatening
eruption
of
the
volcano."

All
three
glanced
up
to
the
summit
of
Bandai-San.
The
smoke
and
flame
had
increased
in
volume.
It
was
a
terrifying
sight
and
instinctively
the
little
party
moved
toward
the
head
of
the
ravine.

They
had
walked
only
a
short
distance
when
a
tremor
shook
the
earth,
sending
a
mass
of
dirt
and
rocks
tumbling
down
the
side
of
the
valley.
Then,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye,
a
thick
cloud
of
ashes
was
showered
upon
them.

Now
thoroughly
frightened,
the
boys
set
out
at
a
run,
Nattie
and
Mori
assisting
the
crippled
youth,
one
on
each
side.
Suddenly
a
dull
shock,
like
the
explosion
of
a
mine,
almost
knocked
them
prostrate,
and
directly
in
front
they
saw
the
earth
fly
from
a
conical
hole
in
the
side
of
the
ravine
with
the
impetus
of
a
hundred-ton
gun.

When
the
dust
and
_débris_
settled,
they
beheld
a
small
crater,
probably
fifteen
feet
in
width,
occupying
a
spot
a
dozen
yards
above
the
dry
bed
of
the
stream.
It
was
only
a
small
affair
as
craters
go,
but
the
mysterious
operation
of
the
natural
volcanic
forces
sent
a
thrill
through
the
lads,
and
they
scrambled
to
their
feet
with
but
one
intent,
and
that
was
to
leave
the
place
as
quickly
as
possible.

"Come!"
hoarsely
exclaimed
Mori,
turning
a
face
pallid
with
dread
to
his
companions.
"We
haven't
a
moment
to
lose.
If
an
eruption
should
occur
and
the
lava
flow
down
this
side
of
the
mountain
nothing
could
save
us
from
a
horrible
death."

"Is
it
as
bad
as
that?"
gasped
Nattie,
glancing
fearfully
toward
the
volcano.

The
answer
came
not
in
words.
Suddenly,
and
with
terrific
force
a
thunderous
report
rent
the
air.
Darkness
darker
than
midnight
fell
upon
the
scene
as
if
a
pall
had
descended
upon
them
from
the
heavens.
A
blinding
shower
of
hot
ashes
and
sand
rained
in
torrents,
then--then
while
the
three
lads
groveled
with
their
faces
in
the
dust
the
earth
rocked
and
rocked,
and
rocked
again.

Presently--was
it
a
moment
or
an
eternity?--a
strange
hissing
noise
became
apparent.
Multiply
the
escaping
steam
from
an
overcharged
boiler
ten
thousand
times
and
you
would
only
have
a
faint
idea
of
the
terrible
noise
that
filled
the
air
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
sounds.

For
the
space
of
many
seconds
the
earth
continued
to
undulate
like
the
surface
of
the
sea.
Explosion
after
explosion
came
in
rapid
succession,
each
seeming
greater
than
its
predecessor,
until
at
last
one
came
that
shook
the
earth
to
its
foundations.

To
the
three
lads
prone
in
the
little
ravine
it
was
as
if
the
end
of
the
world
had
come.
They
lost
all
thought
of
time
or
place.
They
remained
bowed
down
before
the
majestic
forces
of
nature,
incapable
of
moving,
or
speaking,
or
even
thinking.

In
time
the
dread
convulsions
ceased.
Ill
with
a
nausea
like
that
of
the
sea,
Grant
and
Nattie
and
Mori
finally
scrambled
to
their
feet
and
attempted
to
run.
It
was
a
futile
effort.
Their
trembling
limbs
refused
to
carry
them,
and
they
sank
back
once
more.

Let
not
the
reader
think
it
cowardice.
No
more
brave
and
sturdy
youths
than
Nattie
and
Mori
could
be
found
in
all
Japan.
And
Grant--if
feeble
in
frame
and
prone
to
disease
physically,
his
soul
was
absolutely
fearless
in
the
common
happenings
of
life.

Only
those
who
have
experienced
the
awful
feeling
incidental
to
one
of
those
terrible
convulsions
of
nature
called
earthquakes
can
testify
as
to
its
effect
on
the
human
mind.
It
is
the
most
mysterious,
and
the
most
dreadful
force
known
to
man.
The
writer
speaks
from
experience,
having
narrowly
escaped
with
his
life
from
one
encountered
while
on
a
journey
through
a
Central
American
republic.

It
came
without
warning,
and
in
its
duration
of
not
more
than
eight
seconds--think
of
it!--leveled
hundreds
of
houses
and
claimed
a
score
of
human
lives.
Its
immediate
effect
was
as
if
the
earth
was
slipping
away
and
one's
grasp
lost
on
all
things
mundane.




CHAPTER
XXXV.

RETRIBUTION!


It
was
some
time
before
the
boys
could
again
regain
their
feet.
As
the
minutes
slipped
past
without
a
recurrence
of
the
shocks
their
courage
and
self-confidence
returned.
They
did
not
stop
to
discuss
the
matter,
but
promptly
obeyed
their
first
instinct,
which
was
to
leave
the
accursed
spot
without
delay.

They
had
barely
started
down
the
ravine
with
tottering
limbs
when
Nattie,
who
was
in
the
rear
heard
a
hoarse
cry
behind
him.
It
was
not
human.
It
was
harsh
and
gurgling,
like
the
scream
of
a
wild
fowl
in
the
clutches
of
a
giant
eagle.

The
lad
paused
and
glanced
back,
then
he
cried
out
in
horror.
His
companions
instantly
turned
and
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
by
his
outstretched
hand.
Approaching
them
at
a
staggering
walk
was
the
almost
unrecognizable
figure
of
a
tall,
thin
man.

His
clothing
hung
in
charred
tatters
from
a
frame
that
seemed
bent
and
distorted,
evidently
from
some
great
calamity;
the
hat
was
gone,
the
hair
burned
away,
and
caking
the
lower
limbs
as
high
as
the
knees
was
a
mass
of
grayish,
slimy
mud.

As
he
advanced
in
a
series
of
tremulous
lurches
he
stretched
forth
his
hands
in
piteous
supplication.
Presently
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
lay
there
writhing
like
a
wounded
animal.
The
boys
ran
to
his
side.
They
gave
him
one
glance,
then
recoiled
in
horrified
amazement.

"Heavens
above!"
cried
Grant;
"it
is
Willis
Round!"

The
poor
wretch
at
their
feet
twisted
around
and
revealed
a
scarred,
marked
face
with
sightless
eyes.
After
great
effort,
he
whispered,
hoarsely:

"Water!
water!
Give
me
water!"

Luckily,
Nattie
carried
a
canteen-shaped
bottle
of
the
precious
fluid.
Bending
over,
he
placed
it
to
the
sufferer's
lips.
With
what
joy
and
relief
did
he
drink!
The
draught
placed
new
life
in
him.
He
presently
gasped:

"Who
is--is
here?
Is
it
Grant--Grant
Manning?"

"Yes,
it
is
I,"
quickly
replied
the
lame
youth.
"Can
I
do
anything
for
you?
Ha!
why
do
I
ask
such
a
question?
Quick,
Nattie,
Mori;
we
must
take
him
to
the
nearest
town.
He
needs
medical
attendance
at
once."

"It
is
too
late,"
groaned
Round.
"I
am
a
dead
man.
The
end
of
the
world
is
at
hand,
and
I
am
caught
in
sin.
The
others----"

"What
of
them?"
asked
Grant,
eagerly.

"They
are
gone."

"Dead?"

"Yes;
the
volcano
was
shattered
by
the
eruption,
the
liquid
mud
and
earth--ugh!--rolled
down
to
the
caves.
I
saw
it
in
time
and
almost
succeeded
in--in
escaping.
But
Ralph
and
Patrick
were
buried
under
thousands--ugh!--of
tons
of
molten
earth."

For
the
first
time
since
the
convulsion
the
boys
glanced
up
at
the
peak
of
Bandai-San.
To
their
awe
they
saw
that
its
shape
had
been
totally
changed.
Instead
of
the
graceful
cone
with
its
dimple
of
a
crater,
it
now
seemed
shorn
of
half
its
height.
The
summit
was
simply
a
jagged
edge
of
cliff-like
reaches.

[1]In
plain
view
to
the
left
was
a
peculiar
river,
almost
black
in
color,
and
evidently
rolling
down
the
steep
slope
of
the
mountainside
like
the
waters
of
a
cascade.
Dense
clouds
of
steam
hovered
over
it,
and
plainly
apparent
in
the
air
were
strange,
weird
sounds
impossible
to
describe.

The
grewsome
sight
brought
back
the
first
feeling
of
terror,
and
for
a
moment
the
lads
eyed
one
another
in
doubt.
The
desire
to
flee
soon
passed
away,
however,
and
they
again
turned
their
attention
to
the
prostrate
wretch.

A
change
was
coming
over
him.
It
needed
no
medical
skill
to
tell
that
the
man
was
dying.
Nattie
gave
him
more
water,
and
others
made
a
couch
of
their
coats,
but
that
was
all.
Willis
Round
was
beyond
mortal
aid.
In
the
course
of
half
an
hour
he
gave
a
gasp,
half
arose
upon
his
elbow
and
then
fell
back
lifeless.

He
was
buried
where
he
had
died.
Scooping
a
shallow
grave
in
the
soft
earth
he
was
placed
tenderly
within
and
left
to
his
last
rest.
As
they
hurried
away
from
the
spot
a
strange
silence
fell
upon
Grant
and
his
companions.

One
brief
hour
before
they
had
been
eager
in
their
denunciations
of
Ralph
Black
and
his
fellow
conspirators.
Now
all
that
was
changed.
An
awful
fate
had
overtaken
them
in
the
very
midst
of
their
sins.
In
the
presence
of
the
dread
retribution
all
animosity
was
forgotten.
Their
death
was
from
the
awful
hand
of
Nature,
and
their
tomb
under
thousands
of
tons
of
Mother
Earth!

With
all
possible
speed
the
boys
left
the
eventful
ravine.
The
horses
tethered
near
the
spot
of
tableland
had
disappeared,
evidently
stampeded
by
the
convulsions.
In
due
time
the
village
from
which
Ralph
had
taken
his
reinforcements
was
reached.
It
was
entirely
deserted.

At
a
small
town
beyond
the
castle
of
Yamagata,
reached
late
in
the
afternoon,
Sumo
was
found
with
other
natives
more
brave
than
their
fellows.
The
giant
porter
became
wild
with
delight
and
ran
forth
to
meet
the
tired
wayfarers.

"Welcome!
thrice
welcome!"
he
shouted,
bowing
his
huge
bulk
almost
to
the
ground.
"And
thou
escaped
from
old
'Jishin'
after
all?
Glad
am
I,
excellencies;
glad
am
I!
But
where
are
the
fugitives?
And
where
is
the
foreigner,
old
Red-Beard?"

"They
are
dead,"
gravely
replied
Mori.
"They
were
killed
by
the
eruption.
Get
us
meat
and
drink
at
once,
coward.
I
am
minded
to
punish
you
for
your
desertion,
dog."

Sumo
shrugged
his
shoulders
philosophically.

"As
thou
will,
little
master,"
he
replied.
"Punish
if
it
be
in
thy
heart.
I
would
have
fought
for
thee
if
mortal
enemies
threatened,
but
what
is
my
puny
arm
to
that
of
the
underground
demon?"

"I
do
not
blame
you
for
running
away,
Sumo,"
spoke
up
Nattie,
with
an
involuntary
shudder.
"It
was
an
awful
experience,
and
one
I
have
no
desire
to
meet
again."

"Amen!"
fervently
exclaimed
Grant.

That
afternoon
and
night
the
boys
rested.
At
daybreak
on
the
following
day
they
started
for
the
nearest
railway
station,
in
_jinrikishas_.
As
reports
came
in
from
the
country
nearest
to
the
other
slope
of
Bandai-San
the
terrible
nature
of
the
calamity
became
apparent.

Whole
towns
had
been
swept
away
by
the
dreadful
sea
of
molten
mud
thrown
from
the
crater.
Thousands
had
been
injured,
and
a
thousand
lost.
Many
miles
of
land
had
been
ruined.
The
destruction
was
almost
irreparable.

At
Tokio
the
boys
purchased
new
outfits.
They
remained
a
few
hours
in
the
capital,
and
then
left
for
Yokohama.
At
Nattie's
personal
request,
Sumo
had
accompanied
them.
It
was
the
lad's
intention
to
install
the
giant
as
a
factotum
of
the
firm
in
the
counting-room.
It
was
late
in
the
morning
when
they
steamed
into
the
railway
station.
As
they
left
the
train,
Mori
turned
to
Grant
with
a
cry
of
dismay.

"By
Jove!
do
you
know
what
day
this
is?"
he
asked,
excitedly.

"No--that
is--it's----"

"The
first
of
August,
and
the
bids
for
those
army
contracts
are
to
be
opened
at
noon!"

FOOTNOTE:

[1]
An
actual
occurrence.
On
the
sixteenth
of
July,
1888,
the
volcano
of
Bandai-San,
in
Northern
Japan,
exploded,
killing
a
thousand
people.
The
mountain
was
almost
rent
asunder,
one-third
being
turned
into
liquid
mud!




CHAPTER
XXXVI.

CONCLUSION.


"The
army
contracts!"
echoed
Grant.
"Why,
bless
my
soul,
you
are
right!
This
is
the
day
set
by
the
war
department
for
opening
them."

All
three
lads
instinctively
glanced
at
the
station
clock.

"Great
Scott!"
exclaimed
Nattie;
"it's
after
eleven!"

"In
less
than
an
hour
the
board
will
sit,
and
at
Tokio--twenty
miles
away!"
Mori
cried.
"We
have
lost
the
chance
after
all."

"Not
without
a
struggle,"
firmly
replied
the
lame
youth.
"There's
Mr.
Burr
over
there.
He
is
here
to
meet
us.
Nattie,
take
him
to
the
nearest
stationer,
and
purchase
three
or
four
quires
of
official
paper,
pen
and
ink.
Be
back
in
five
minutes.
Mori,
come
with
me."

While
Nattie,
too
bewildered
to
speak,
hurried
away
on
his
errand,
Grant
grasped
the
Japanese
youth's
arm,
and
almost
ran
to
the
station
master's
office.
They
found
the
official
seated
at
his
desk.

"What
time
does
the
next
train
leave
for
the
capital?"
asked
Grant.

"At
eleven-thirty,
sir."

"Too
late.
How
long
will
it
take
you
to
start
a
special
train?"

The
railway
employee
stared
at
his
questioner
in
surprise.

"A
special
train
for
Tokio?"
he
asked.

"Yes."

"We
couldn't
have
it
ready
under
twenty
minutes.
Why,
what----"

"Never
mind
the
reason,
sir,"
interrupted
Grant,
impatiently.
"I
must
be
in
Tokio
before
twelve
o'clock."

"It
is
impossible,
sir."

"Not
at
all.
It
must
be
done.
Where
is
the
engine
that
brought
the
train
in
a
few
moments
ago?"

"It
is
still
in
the
station,
but
it
will
go
to
the
running
sheds
before
long."

"I
must
have
that
engine,"
exclaimed
Grant,
with
determination.
"I
will
pay
you
five
hundred
_yen_
for
an
hour's
use
of
it.
I
will
also
give
a
bonus
of
fifty
_yen_
each
to
the
engineer
and
fireman."

Five
minutes
later
a
powerful
locomotive
left
the
station,
bearing
the
party.
A
small
table
had
been
secured,
and
hard
at
work
upon
it
was
Mr.
Burr,
writing
for
dear
life
as
Grant
dictated.

The
line
was
clear,
telegraphic
orders
having
been
sent
to
that
effect
from
Yokohama,
and
the
intricate
mass
of
iron
flew
upon
its
journey
at
the
rate
of
seventy
miles
an
hour.

It
was
a
strange
spectacle,
and
one
never
before
witnessed
in
all
Japan.
To
the
engineer
and
fireman,
native
born,
it
was
a
novelty
indeed,
and
they
cast
many
curious
glances
at
the
group
upon
the
tender.

As
the
miles
were
covered
at
terrific
speed,
the
ponderous
engine
swayed
and
rocked
like
a
ship
in
distress.
But
amid
the
lurching
and
tossing
of
the
fabric,
Grant
stood
imperturbably
droning
word
after
word,
sentence
upon
sentence,
while
the
canny
Scot
jotted
them
down
as
best
he
could.

The
document
was
a
lengthy
one,
full
of
circumlocution
and
dreary
phrases,
but
at
the
end
of
twelve
minutes,
when
the
outskirts
of
Tokio
came
in
sight,
it
was
finished.
The
three
members
of
the
firm
affixed
their
names
just
as
the
panting
engine
came
to
a
sudden
stop
in
the
railway
station
of
the
capital.

_Jinrikishas_
with
fleet
_karumayas_
had
been
ordered
by
telegraph.
The
distance
to
the
war
department
was
at
least
a
mile.
Springing
into
the
vehicles,
the
party
were
carried
swiftly
through
the
streets,
a
promise
of
ten
times
the
usual
fare
having
lent
wings
to
the
men's
feet.

A
clock
observed
midway
indicated
a
quarter
of
twelve.

"On,
on,
men!"
cried
Grant,
imploringly.
"Fifty
_yen_
each
if
you
do
it
before
the
stroke
of
twelve."

The
promise
was
as
a
whip
to
a
spirited
horse.
From
lagging
steps
the
_karumayas_
bounded
into
a
run.
Down
the
narrow
streets
they
darted,
past
gardens,
through
thoroughfares
crowded
with
pedestrians;
on,
on,
until
at
last,
with
a
final
spurt,
the
four
_jinrikishas_
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
Japanese
war
office.

Leaving
Mr.
Burr
to
settle
with
the
coolies--who
had
well
earned
their
pay--Grant
dashed
into
the
building
just
as
the
first
stroke
of
a
sonorous
bell
overhead
proclaimed
the
hour
of
noon.

As
he
passed
through
the
entrance
he
noticed
a
door
at
the
right
bearing
upon
its
panels
in
Japanese,
"War
Department.
Office
of
the
Army
Board."
It
was
standing
slightly
ajar,
and
from
the
interior
came
a
confused
murmur
of
voices.

Something
prompted
Grant
and
his
companions
to
stop
and
peer
through.
Seated
at
a
large
desk
were
several
officers
in
uniform
and
other
gentlemen
in
civilian's
clothes.
In
the
center
was
Yoshisada
Udono,
Grant's
friend.
Occupying
chairs
in
the
main
portion
of
the
room
were
the
German
merchants
of
Yokohama,
Swartz
and
Bauer,
and
Ralph's
father,
Jesse
Black.

The
warning
bell
had
reached
the
seventh
stroke!

Arising
to
his
feet
with
a
triumphant
smile
upon
his
lean,
suave
face,
the
English
merchant
advanced
to
the
desk
and
laid
thereon
a
packet.
As
he
turned
to
resume
his
seat
there
was
a
noise
at
the
door,
and
the
lame
youth
marched
in
with
calm
dignity.

"Ah,
I
see
I
am
just
in
time,"
he
said,
with
a
pleasant
smile.
"Mr.
Udono,
will
you
please
accept
our
bid
for
the
contracts?"

"Certainly,
Grant,
with
the
greatest
pleasure,"
quickly
replied
the
secretary.
"Where
have
you
been?
I
actually
thought
you
would
be----"

He
was
interrupted
by
a
snarl
of
mingled
stupefaction
and
rage.
Mr.
Black,
who
had
been
staring
open
mouthed
at
the
lads,
sprang
forward,
and
shouted:

"It
is
too
late!
It
is
past
the
time.
The
hour
of
twelve----"

"Has
not
struck
yet,"
quietly
interrupted
Grant.
"Listen!
ten,
eleven,
twelve!
I
was
three
seconds
to
the
good."

If
ever
baffled
fury
sat
enthroned
on
a
man's
countenance
it
did
then
upon
that
of
the
English
merchant.
He
was
speechless
with
anger
and
disappointment.
Shaking
his
fist
in
Grant's
face,
he
stammered
and
choked
in
a
futile
effort
to
berate
him.

"Mr.
Black,
a
word
with
you,"
suddenly
said
Nattie,
stepping
up.

The
lad's
tone
was
full
of
meaning.
He
turned
and
added
to
his
brother
and
Mori:

"Let
us
leave
for
some
quiet
place
and
have
it
over
with.
You
know
we
have
a
sad
duty
to
perform."

"What,
what's
that?"
asked
the
merchant,
in
alarm,
recovering
his
speech.
"My
son
Ralph!
What
of
him?
Don't
tell
me
he
is
injured."

"Come
with
us,"
replied
Grant,
evasively.

Leaving
Mori
to
make
a
brief
explanation
to
Mr.
Udono,
Nattie
and
he
took
the
Englishman
into
a
side
room
and
there
told
the
story
of
his
son's
awful
end.

It
is
a
strange
commentary
on
human
nature
that
even
the
vilest
beast
contains
a
well
of
tenderness.
The
hand
that
slays
in
cruel
sport
can
also
caress
with
fond
affection.
The
African
mother
has
her
maternal
love;
the
foulest
rogue
a
word
of
kindness.

Mr.
Black
was
an
unscrupulous
man.
He
was
a
scoundrel
at
heart,
but
there
was
an
oasis
in
the
desert
of
his
immoral
nature.
It
was
his
love
for
his
son
Ralph.
The
news
of
his
offspring's
death
came
as
a
terrible
blow.
His
grief
was
pitiful.

The
spectacle
of
a
strong
man
weeping
in
agony
of
spirit
swept
away
all
thoughts
of
punishment.
Grant
exchanged
glances
with
his
brother,
and
then
said,
sadly,
but
with
firmness:

"Mr.
Black,
we
know
everything.
We
know
fully
your
connection
with
the
foul
plot
to
abduct
me,
but
we
are
content
with
our
triumph
over
you.
We
could
have
you
arrested
and
sent
to
prison
for
a
term
of
years,
but
we
will
be
merciful.
You
can
go
forth
in
freedom,
but
on
certain
conditions."

The
miserable
man
stood
listening
with
bowed
head.

"You
must
leave
Japan
at
once,"
continued
Grant,
"and
also
make
restitution
of
the
money
overpaid
to
you
on
account
of
our
father's
debt.
That
debt
was
paid
to
you
before
his
death,
and
you
know
it."

"No,
Grant,
your
father
did
not
pay
me,"
replied
Mr.
Black,
brokenly.

"Then
you
still
deny
it!"
exclaimed
the
lame
youth,
his
voice
growing
hard.

"I
will
explain.
I
received
part
of
the
money,
but
not
from
your
father.
The
day
Mr.
Manning
died
in
his
office
I
received
a
call
from
Willis
Round.
He
said
that
he
had
taken
the
fifty-six
hundred
dollars
in
gold
from
the
safe,
and
would
divide
with
me
if
I
would
promise
to
back
him
up
in
pushing
the
firm
to
the
wall.
It
was
his
idea
to
purchase
the
good
will
of
the
business
at
a
forced
sale
and
start
in
for
himself.
I--I
consented,
but
our
plans
have
failed."

"Through
no
fault
of
yours,"
said
Nattie,
_sotto
voce_.

"Do
you
agree
to
the
conditions?"
asked
Grant.

"Yes,
I
will
do
as
you
say,"
replied
the
disgraced
merchant.
"I
will
repay
you
and
leave
this
country
at
once.
I
am
content
to
do
so.
Oh,
Ralph,
my
son,
my
son!"

He
tottered
from
the
room,
and
that
was
the
last
the
lads
saw
of
him.
On
the
following
day
a
messenger
brought
to
them
in
their
office
at
Yokohama
a
package
of
money
containing
the
amount
previously
paid
to
Mr.
Black.

Before
the
end
of
the
week
he
had
settled
up
his
affairs
and
left
Japan.
It
was
heard
later
that
he
had
returned
to
England,
where
he
went
into
retirement
with
the
money
saved
from
his
business.
It
is
to
be
hoped
he
sought
repentance
for
his
misdeeds.

In
these
o'er-true
tales
it
is
a
pleasure
to
part
with
some
characters,
but
painful
to
bid
farewell
to
others.
A
writer
has
his
likes
and
dislikes,
even
in
his
own
literature.
It
is
said
that
the
immortal
Dickens
cried
when
he
penned
the
description
of
Little
Nell's
death
in
the
"Old
Curiosity
Shop,"
and
that
his
heart
stirred
with
a
curious
anger
as
he
chronicled
the
villainies
of
Bill
Sykes
in
another
story.

It
is
probably
for
a
similar
reason
that
I
do
not
like
to
write
the
words
that
will
put
an
end
for
all
time
to
Grant
and
Nattie
and
Mori.
We
have
spent
many
pleasant
half
hours
together.
It
has
been
a
pleasure
to
depict
their
honesty,
and
manliness,
and
truth,
to
watch
their
brave
struggle
against
misfortune,
and
at
last
to
record
their
final
triumph.

They
will
succeed
in
life--integrity
and
moral
worth
always
do.
They
secured
the
famous
contract,
and
made
a
legitimate
profit
from
it.
That
was
before
the
recent
war
between
China
and
Japan.
They
invested
their
increased
capital,
and
are
now,
at
the
present
date,
on
the
fair
road
to
fortune.

Mr.
Burr
is
the
manager
of
their
Yokohama
house.
Mori
is
in
general
charge
of
the
business
in
Japan,
and
Grant
and
Nattie
are
now
traveling
in
the
United
States
visiting
their
relatives
and
quietly
keeping
an
eye
out
for
the
trade.

Sumo
is
established
in
the
main
office
as
porter
and
messenger.
He
sports
a
gorgeous
uniform
and
is
ever
relating
to
the
small
boys
of
the
neighborhood
his
memorable
fight
with
Raiko,
the
thug,
at
the
foot
of
old
Bandai-San.

And
now,
in
the
language
of
those
gentle
people,
the
Japanese,
I
will
say
"_Sayonara!_"

The
Rockspur
Athletic
Series

By
GILBERT
PATTEN.

Consists
of
three
books,
each
being
a
good,
clean
story
of
athletic
training,
sports
and
contests,
such
as
interest
every
healthy,
growing
boy
of
to-day.

While
aiming
to
avoid
the
extravagant
and
sensational,
the
stories
contain
enough
thrilling
incidents
to
please
the
lad
who
loves
action
and
adventure.
The
description
of
their
Baseball
and
Football
Games
and
other
contests
with
rival
clubs
and
teams
make
very
exciting
and
absorbing
reading;
and
few
boys
with
warm
blood
in
their
veins,
having
once
begun
the
perusal
of
one
of
these
books,
will
willingly
lay
it
down
till
it
is
finished.

1--The
Rockspur
Nine.
A
story
of
Baseball.

2--The
Rockspur
Eleven.
A
story
of
Football.

3--The
Rockspur
Rivals.
A
story
of
Winter
Sports.

Each
volume
contains
about
300
pages,

in
size,

binding,

volume,

and
you
do

even

with
the
full

of

See
paragraph

below.

There
are
a

of
things

Information
about
Donations
to
the
Project
Gutenberg
Literary
Archive
Foundation

Project
Gutenberg-tm
depends
upon
and
cannot
survive
without
wide
spread
public
support
and
donations
to
carry
out
its
mission
of
increasing
the
number
of
public
domain
and
licensed
works
that
can
be
freely
distributed
in
machine
readable
form
accessible
by
the
widest
array
of
equipment
including
outdated
equipment.

Many
small
donations
($1
to
$5,000)
are
particularly
important
to
maintaining
tax
exempt
status
with
the
IRS.

The
Foundation
is
committed
to
complying
with
the
laws
regulating
charities
and
charitable
donations
in
all
50
states
of
the
United
States.

Compliance
requirements
are
not
uniform
and
it
takes
a
considerable
effort,
much
paperwork
and
many
fees
to
meet
and
keep
up
with
these
requirements.

We
do
not
solicit
donations
in
locations
where
we
have
not
received
written
confirmation
of
compliance.

To
SEND
DONATIONS
or
determine
the
status
of
compliance
for
any
particular
state
visit
http://pglaf.org

While
we
cannot
and
do
not
solicit
contributions
from
states
where
we
have
not
met
the
solicitation
requirements,
we
know
of
no
prohibition
against
accepting
unsolicited
donations
from
donors
in
such
states
who
approach
us
with
offers
to
donate.

International
donations
are
gratefully
accepted,
but
we
cannot
make
any
statements
concerning
tax
treatment
of
donations
received
from
outside
the
United
States.

U.S.
laws
alone
swamp
our
small
staff.

Please
check
the
Project
Gutenberg

current
donation
methods
and

Donations
are
accepted
in

General
Information
About
Project
Gutenberg-tm
electronic
works.

Professor
Michael
S.
Hart
is
the
originator
of
the
Project
Gutenberg-tm
concept
of
a
library
of
electronic
works
that
could
be
freely
shared
with
anyone.

For
thirty
years,
he
produced
and
distributed
Project
Gutenberg-tm
eBooks
with
only
a
loose
network
of
volunteer
support.


Project
Gutenberg-tm
eBooks
are
often
created
from
several
printed
editions,
all
of
which
are
confirmed
as
Public
Domain
in
the
U.S.
unless
a
copyright
notice
is
included.

Thus,
we
do
not
necessarily
keep
eBooks
in
compliance
with
any
particular
paper
edition.

people
